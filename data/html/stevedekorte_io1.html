<h1 id="about">ABOUT</h1>
<p>Io is a dynamic prototype-based programming language. The programming guide and reference manual can be found in the docs folder.</p>

<p>Io is two parts - the vm and the <code>addons/packages</code>. Don’t worry if all the addons don’t compile for you - some are platform specific or not well supported.</p>
<p>There are a couple ways you can go about building Io, I will give the recommended way, and a note about how to do it alternatively.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are installing in a production environment, use <code>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..</code> in all the <code>cmake ..</code> lines below. This tells CMake to compile with standard optimizations. Without the <code>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release</code> addition the resulting binaries will have been compiled in debug mode with no standard C optimizations applied.</p>
<h2 id="os-x">OS X</h2>
<p>If you are using the homebrew package manager you can install Io (though it may not be the latest version) with:</p>
<pre><code>brew install io</code></pre>
<p>Note: Assuming you wish to install to an alternate location, ensure you supply as an argument to the following command, a <code>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path</code> where <code>/path</code> is where you wish to install Io to. This is akin to setting <code>INSTALL_PREFIX</code> with the old build system if you are familiar with it, or <code>--prefix</code> with GNU autotools if you are familiar with that suite.</p>
<p>Ensure you are at the top level of the source tree, that is where this file lives. From here, you are in the right spot to enter these commands:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install</code></pre>
<p>If you do not wish to install, just run <code>make</code> instead of <code>make install</code>. Currently there is no analogue to the old <code>make linkInstall</code>. However, if you have used <code>linkInstall</code> in previous versions of Io, you should never have to run <code>linkInstall</code> again, since it created symbolic links to where your Io source was at that time. The only time you would have to do this again, is if you moved the Io source from one dir to another. Most people don’t.</p>

<h2 id="ode">ODE</h2>
<p>When I tried to install ode via brew, it didn’t come preinstalled with drawstuff library. So the solution is to compile and install ode directly. Instructions are from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode" class="uri">https://bitbucket.org/odedevs/ode</a></p>
