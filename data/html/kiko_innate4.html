<p>Please consider giving us a heads up about what worked for you if it isn’t in the list yet.</p>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>Innate supports multiple templating engines and it is very easy to add your own. At the moment we offer following engines out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>How to build your own is discussed at .</p>
<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>
<p>Innate follows a different approach than most frameworks, making the controller subclassing obsolete. To make an object accessible from the outside simply include Innate::Node and map it to the location you would like to serve.</p>
<h2 id="differences-from-ramaze">Differences from Ramaze</h2>
<p>Innate throws a lot overboard; it doesn’t provide all the bells and whistles that you may be used to. This makes Ramaze the way to go for larger applications.</p>
<p>For this reason, Innate is not only a standalone framework, it is also the core of Ramaze.</p>
<p>Ramaze started out without any of the benefits that Rack gives us these days, especially regarding the server handlers, request/response, and middleware.</p>
<p>Still it tried to provide everything one might need with the least effort, leading to a lot dependencies (we had things like bacon, simple_http, gettext, mime types, …)</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Innate provides the Innate::Options DSL, similar in some aspects to the old Ramaze::Global, but a lot more flexible.</p>
