<h1 id="gemify-the-gemspec-generator">Gemify, the gemspec generator</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Gemify is a simple tool which helps you generate gemspecs (which are used for building gems) and verify that your project follows the common and proven way to structure your Ruby packages.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Generating gemspec:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install gemify
$ cd myproject (which doesn&#39;t have a gemspec yet)
$ gemify
Gemify needs to know a bit about your project, but should be
able to guess most of the information. Type the value if you
need to correct it, or press ENTER to accept the suggestion by Gemify.

Project name:        gemify? 
Namespace:           Gemify? 
Library:             lib/gemify?
