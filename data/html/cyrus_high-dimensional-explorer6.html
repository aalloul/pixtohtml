<p>2E) How do I prepare my data before running HiDEx? ****************************************************************************</p>
<p>There are two choices for getting co-occurrence data when using HiDEx: use your own corpus or downloading a pre-built set of co-occurrence data. First I will describe the process of using a corpus, and then I will explain how download and install a set of vectors from the Internet.</p>
<p>The amount of processing power, hard disk and processing time required to process a corpus is large, but feasible on a modern workstation or server. On most computers I have tested it will take approximately three days to process a 1 billion word corpus. The raw matrix that HiDEx creates from that corpus will be 60Gb in size or larger. Once this process is done once, it will not have to be done again for that corpus.</p>
<p>Step 1: Obtain or download a large corpus of text. I have created a very large corpus of USENET text that is available freely under a Creative Commons license. It is available here:</p>
<p>http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/~westburylab/downloads/usenetcorpus.download.html</p>
<p>Step 2: If the corpus is not the above corpus, please change the corpus so that it follows the following format :</p>
<pre><code> [Text]
 [Document Separator]
 [Text]
 [Document Separator]
 [Text]
 [Document Separator]</code></pre>
<p>Choose a very uncommon string to act as your document separator. I recommend:</p>
<p>—END.OF.DOCUMENT—</p>
<p>Make sure that there is one of these between every document in your corpus. Do not worry about capitalization, punctuation, numbers or other symbols, as they will be removed by HiDEx. Do make sure to remove any markup (such as SGML, HTML or other markup language with tags).</p>
<p>If possible, remove any redundant, non-content text (such as “Courtesy of the XYZ News Wire Service”) if it is in all the documents.</p>
