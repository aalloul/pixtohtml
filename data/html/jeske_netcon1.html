<h2 id="what-is-netcon">What is Netcon?</h2>
<p>Netcon is an operational machine and service monitoring tool. It allows you to setup monitoring for machine paramaters such as CPU, and Disk Usage, as well as services such as HTTP, and MySQL. When any of the reported data for these services meets a set of pre-determined triggers, the people responsible for those services can be notified.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-different-about-netcon">What is different about Netcon?</h2>
<p>One of Netcon’s primary goals is to separate the discovery of individual errors from the notification process. Instead of receiving individual notifications about service problems, which can often include tens or hundreds of notifications, with Netcon the user receives strictly time-periodic updates of the system state during an incident. For example, you might receive one notification every five minutes during an incident, each one telling you how many service failures are still pending on that incident, followed by a notification when the incident is resolved and cleared.</p>
<p>Another primary goal of Netcon is to configure failure conditions not only in terms of discerete failure events (such as service-down), but also in terms of the predicted time to reach a failure threshold. For example, Netcon can be configured to alert you when it’s predicted that available diskspace will reach &lt;10% in less than 12 hours. To do this prediction, it uses a simple linear regression of available disk-space over a few time periods.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-does-netcon-do">What else does Netcon do?</h2>
<p>The Netcon data collection uses a uniform and extendable naming scheme for storing service status metrics. The same history that records the CPU usage of a machine over time is used to record the duration of a trigger or failure – allowing both to leverage the same display and graphing capabilities. This makes it easy to build up many layers to the system.<br />
For example, by setting up an agent to report to Netcon the user-impact of an incident, Netcon can report on the user-percieved impact of failures over time.</p>
<p>Netcon’s basic architecture borrows my favorite features from other tools. Like QOS, it has a lightweight data-collection agent which is deployed as needed to query data, and which can be easily extended with application-specific collectors. Like Netsaint/Nagios, it has an SQL backend database and a configuration and information browsing UI. Like some larger commercial counterparts, configuration is performed from the Netcon web user-interface. This means it is easy to configure, and since this configuration is stored in the</p>
