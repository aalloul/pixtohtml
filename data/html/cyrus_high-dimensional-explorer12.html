<p>neighbourhoodSize: When not using neighborhood thresholds, the number of neighbors to find.</p>
<p>separate: Enables separate forward and backward vectors when set to 1. When set to 0, Forward and Backward vectors are combined, halving the context size.</p>
<p>wordlistfilename: List of words to analyze (it will usually be a list of words, one per line. Only when using getsimilarity mode will you need to proved a list of word pairs, two words per line, separated by tabs.)</p>
<p>wordlistsize: Used for picking random sub-samples from a word list. If this number is smaller than the number of words in the wordlist, HiDEx will pick a random subset of the words in the wordlistfile to use. If this number is larger than the number of words in the wordlistfile, or if the setting is left blank, HiDEx will use all the words in the file set by wordlistfilename.</p>
<p>saveGCM: If this is set to “1”, HiDEx will create a large text file called “dbname.gcm” in the working directory. This file will be automatically detected the next time a GCM is required, and loaded. Depending on the speed of your computer, this may be faster or slower than building the GCM on the fly.</p>
<p>With the addition of Unicode support, there are two new options</p>
<p>normCase: Apply case normalization globally. This option will take any Unicode character than can have a lower-case glyph, and replace it with that glyph. The default mode is 1 (true). To stop case normalization, set this to 0 (false). There is one more important factor to correct case normalization: your shell’s environment variable settings for the LANG variable. HiDEx will check this setting and appy the correct normalization only if this is set to the correct language. For example, if you are processing German, your LANG setting should be set to de_DE.UTF-8</p>
<p>englishContractions: In English, the string “’s” is a contraction that can make it difficult for the model to recognize words that are possessives. This defaults to 1 (true), which means that words like “ball’s” will be split into two words, “ball” and “’s” and “can’t” will become “can” and “’nt”. englishContractions=1</p>

<p>useVariance: In previous versions of HiDEx, the context was created from the N most frequent words in the corpus. In the original HAL paper (Lund &amp; Burgess, 1996), the vectors for the N most variant words were used instead. This feature implements the method from Lund &amp;</p>
