<h2 id="lua-alchemy-is-no-longer-supported">Lua Alchemy is no longer supported</h2>
<p>Dear Lua Alchemy users,</p>
<p>Thank you for your support in all these years! As you know, Lua Alchemy is based on the old Adobe Alchemy technology, which is no longer supported by Adobe.</p>
<p>If you need Lua support in the browser, take a look at and other JS-based implementations. They are the future.</p>
<p>If you really need to use Lua in Adobe Flash, you may want to find someone to sponsor Lua Alchemy port to engineers are available to do the actual work, but, alas, I do not have resources to do this as an unpaid personal hobby project myself. If you’re interested, please contact us at lua-alchemy@logiceditor.com.</p>
<p>If you need commercial support for the current Lua Alchemy, write at the same address.</p>
<p>You can get free support from the community at the .</p>
<p>– Alexander Gladysh, the Lua Alchemy maintainer.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Lua is a great dynamic programming language, Adobe Flash is a great universal platform for applications and Adobe Alchemy is the tool to bind them together.</p>
<p>The main webpage can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/lua-alchemy/</p>
<h2 id="lua">Lua</h2>
<p>Lua is a powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language.</p>
<p>Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.</p>

<h2 id="adobe-flash">Adobe Flash</h2>
<p>Adobe Flash (previously called “Macromedia Flash”’) is a set of multimedia software created by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages; Flash is commonly used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page components, to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet applications.</p>
