<p>Everyone learns different, some only read the source, others browse documentation, but everyone loves examples for a quick and painless start.</p>
<p>Ramaze addresses this need and offers a wide variety of examples of usage, basic functionality, project-layout and more advanced applications.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fully BDD (Behaviour Driven Design)</p>
<p>Ramaze has a very complete set of so-called specifications built by RSpec. These specs define the way Ramaze has to behave.</p>
<p>The specs are checked every time a new patch is pushed into the repository, deciding whether the changes the patch applies are valid and don’t break the framework.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="rubygems">RubyGems</h3>
<p>The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via the gem.</p>
<p>is the package manager for ruby apps and libraries and provides you with the last tagged version of Ramaze.</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze</code></pre>
<p>Versions are made as we see fit and get an announcement out (usually that’s the major obstacle as there is a lot to announce).</p>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>To get the latest and sweetest, you can just pull from the repository and run Ramaze that way.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/ramaze/ramaze.git</code></pre>
<p>Please read the <code>man git</code> or <code>git help</code> for more information about updating and creating your own patches. This is at the moment the premier way to use Ramaze, since it is the way I use it.</p>
<p>Some hints for the usage of Git.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <code>require 'ramaze'</code> from everywhere</p>
<p>Simply add the path to your repository to the RUBYLIB environment variable. If you are using bash you can simply put following line into your .bashrc:</p>
<pre><code>$ export RUBYLIB=&quot;$HOME/path/to/repo/lib/&quot;</code></pre></li>
</ul>
