<p>There are a large number of people who made Ramaze possible by their ongoing efforts in the world of open source and by encouraging and helping me.</p>
<p>This list is by no means a full listing of all these people, but I try to get a good coverage despite that.</p>
<p>I would like to thank:</p>
<ul>

<p>For giving the world Ruby and bringing fun back into programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Zed Shaw a.k.a. zedas</p>
<p>For developing Mongrel, Ramaze started out as a simple Hello World based on that awesome server.</p></li>

<p>For building rack, which is just what the numerous web-developers had anticipated and which will, with no doubt, change the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Pistos</p>
