<p>Cool.io is an event library for Ruby, built on the libev event library which provides a cross-platform interface to high performance system calls . This includes the epoll system call for Linux, the kqueue system call for BSDs and OS X, and the completion ports interface for Solaris.</p>
<p>Cool.io also binds asynchronous wrappers to Rubyâ€™s core socket classes so you can use them in conjunction with Cool.io to build asynchronous event-driven applications.</p>
<p>You can include Cool.io in your programs with:</p>
<pre><code>require &#39;cool.io&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>
<p>Cool.io builds on two core classes which bind to the libev API:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cool.io::Loop - This class represents an event loop which uses underlying high performance system calls to wait for events.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool.io::Watcher - This is the base class for event observers. Once you attach an event observer to a loop and start running it, you will begin receiving callbacks to particlar methods when events occur.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="watchers">Watchers</h2>
<p>There are presently four types of watchers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cool.io::IOWatcher - This class waits for an IO object to become readable, writable, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool.io::TimerWatcher - This class waits for a specified duration then fires an event. You can also configure it to fire an event at specified intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Cool.io::StatWatcher - Monitors files or directories for changes</p></li>
<li><p>Cool.io::AsyncWatcher - Can be used to wake up a Cool.io::Loop running in a different thread. This allows each thread to run a separate Cool.io::Loop and for the different event loops to be able to signal each other.</p></li>
</ul>
