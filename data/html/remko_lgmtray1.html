<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>LGMTray is a lightweight application that docks in your system tray, and notifies you when new mail has arrived on your GMail account.</p>
<p>It is written in C++, is designed to have very few dependencies, and can therefore be easily built on many systems. Currently, only an X11 implementation is available (which uses the , and the features are very limited.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Copy the sample configuration file <code>lgmtray.sample_config</code>, rename it to <code>~/.lgmtray</code>, and edit it to reflect your username/password and preferences. Then, simply run the application by calling <code>lgmtray</code>.</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. LGMTray currently needs the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>libxpm</li>
<li>Xlib (ships with your X installation)</li>
</ul>
<p>To build the project, run</p>
<pre><code>    make</code></pre>
<p>If you have a special system setup, you should edit <code>Makefile.config</code> to reflect this in the build parameters.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>On one of my machines, Curl crashes very regularly with a SIGPIPE when opening a connection. I have reported this to the Curl developers, but no cause has been found so far. As a workaround, LGMTray currently ignores SIGPIPE signals, and continues as normal. This should have no visual impact, except log messages saying that there was a problem, and that the application continues anyway.</p>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow the background of the tray to be transparent, taking the system tray’s background color.</li>
<li>Make the check interval dynamic, where mail is checked more frequently after new mail has arrived, less frequently when there is no mouse movement, …</li>
</ul>
