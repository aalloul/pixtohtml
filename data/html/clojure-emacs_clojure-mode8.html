<ul>
<li>The use of [paredit][] when editing Clojure (or any other Lisp) code is highly recommended. It helps ensure the structure of your forms is not compromised and offers a number of operations that work on code structure at a higher level than just characters and words. To enable it for Clojure buffers:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="el"><code>(add-hook &#39;clojure-mode-hook #&#39;paredit-mode)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>[smartparens][] is an excellent (newer) alternative to paredit. Many Clojure hackers have adopted it recently and you might want to give it a try as well. To enable <code>smartparens</code> use the following code:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="el"><code>(add-hook &#39;clojure-mode-hook #&#39;smartparens-strict-mode)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>[RainbowDelimiters][] is a minor mode which highlights parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given depth. Assuming you’ve already installed <code>RainbowDelimiters</code> you can enable it like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="el"><code>(add-hook &#39;clojure-mode-hook #&#39;rainbow-delimiters-mode)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>[aggressive-indent-mode][] automatically adjust the indentation of your code, while you’re writing it. Using it together with <code>clojure-mode</code> is highly recommended. Provided you’ve already installed <code>aggressive-indent-mode</code> you can enable it like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="el"><code>(add-hook &#39;clojure-mode-hook #&#39;aggressive-indent-mode)</code></pre>
<h2 id="repl-interaction">REPL Interaction</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental aspects of Lisps in general and Clojure in particular is the notion of interactive programming - building your programs by continuously changing the state of the running Lisp program (as opposed to doing something more traditional like making a change and re-running the program afterwards to see the changes in</p>
