<pre><code>the delta-time from the first send of the packet to the
ack.  A number in parens following a send is the
delta-time from the first send of the packet to the
current send (on duplicate packets only).  Duplicate
sends or acks have a number in square brackets showing
the number of duplicates so far.

Here is a short sample from near the start of an ftp:
    3.00    0.20   send . 512
    3.20    0.20    ack . 1024  (0.20)
    3.20    0.00   send P 1024
    3.40    0.20    ack . 1536  (0.20)
    3.80    0.40 * send . 0  (3.80) [2]
    3.82    0.02 *  ack . 1536  (0.62) [2]
Three seconds into the conversation, bytes 512 through 1023
were sent.  200ms later they were acked.  Shortly thereafter
bytes 1024-1535 were sent and again acked after 200ms.
Then, for no apparent reason, 0-511 is retransmitted, 3.8
seconds after its initial send (the round trip time for this
ftp was 1sec, +-500ms).  Since the receiver is expecting
1536, 1536 is re-acked when 0 arrives.</code></pre>
<p>packetdat.awk Computes chunk summary data for an ftp (or similar unidirectional tcp transfer). [A “chunk” refers to a chunk of the sequence space – essentially the packet sequence number divided by the max segment size.]</p>
<pre><code>A summary line is printed showing the number of chunks,
the number of packets it took to send that many chunks
(if there are no lost or duplicated packets, the number
of packets should equal the number of chunks) and the
number of acks.

Following the summary line is one line of information
per chunk.  The line contains eight fields:
   1 - the chunk number
   2 - the start sequence number for this chunk
   3 - time of first send
   4 - time of last send
   5 - time of first ack
   6 - time of last ack
   7 - number of times chunk was sent
   8 - number of times chunk was acked
(all times are in decimal seconds, relative to the start
of the conversation.)

As an example, here is the first part of the output for
an ftp trace:</code></pre>
