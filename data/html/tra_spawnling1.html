<h1 id="news">News</h1>
<p>2013-4-15 gem renamed from “spawn-block” (lame) to “spawnling” (awesome). Sadly the name “spawn” was taken before I got around to making this into a gem so I decided to give it a new name and a new home.</p>
<p>Also, now runs with ruby 1.9 (and later). Because ruby “stole” the name “spawn”, this gem now has been redefined to use “Spawnling.new(&amp;block)” instead of “spawn(&amp;block)”. Other than that nothing has changed in the basic usage. Read below for detailed usage.</p>
<h1 id="spawnling-1">Spawnling</h1>
<p>This gem provides a ‘Spawnling’ class to easily fork OR thread long-running sections of code so that your application can return results to your users more quickly. It works by creating new database connections in ActiveRecord::Base for the spawned block so that you don’t have to worry about database connections working, they just do.</p>
<p>The gem also patches ActiveRecord::Base to handle some known bugs when using threads if you prefer using the threaded model over forking.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The name of the gem is “spawnling” (unfortunately somebody took the name “spawn” before I was able to convert this to a gem).</p>

<p>If you want to live on the latest master branch, add this to your Gemfile,</p>
<pre><code>gem &#39;spawnling&#39;, :git =&gt; &#39;https://github.com/tra/spawnling&#39;</code></pre>
<p>and use bundler to manage it (bundle install, bundle update).</p>

<p>If you’d rather install from the latest gem,</p>
<pre><code>gem &#39;spawnling&#39;, &#39;~&gt;2.1&#39;</code></pre>
