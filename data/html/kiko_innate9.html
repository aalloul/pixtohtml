<p>Well, this might be the most obvious candidate for removal, maybe it can be revived as middleware. The functionality itself was in the adapter and even that’s only a few lines. But so far I have never seen any usage of it.</p>
<h5 id="toollocalize">Tool::Localize</h5>
<p>Despite being quite popular it has many issues and is totally unusable if you don’t have full knowledge about what is going to be served.</p>
<p>I and a lot of other people have used this over time and it has proven itself to be a very easy and straightforward way of doing localization.</p>
<p>It think it is better suited as middleware which can be included into rack-contrib and doesn’t rely on the normal session but a simple unobfuscated cookie.</p>
<p>Innate does not attempt to do anything related to localization. Ramaze builds localization on top of Helper::Localize which does a much better job.</p>
<h5 id="toolmime">Tool::MIME</h5>
<p>This one was removed, Rack::Mime is the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="spec-helpers">Spec helpers</h3>
<p>Over the years, Ramaze has collected a wide variety of spec helpers that are not really compatible with each other and rely on real request/response with a running server.</p>
<p>Innate provides a better alternative via Innate::Mock for specs, the output formatting is done in a rake task.</p>
<p>There is some work in progress to integrate Innate and Ramaze with the rack-test library which will allow us to run specs with webrat (which is able to run using selenium and possibly watir in a DRY way).</p>
<p>Rack-test will provide us also with xpath checks, multipart requests, digest authorization, etc.</p>
<h3 id="snippets">Snippets</h3>
<p>Innate abandons the snippets, keeping your core clean.</p>
<p>Ramaze has still a lot of these snippets and will continue to, although I will constantly strive to reduce them slowly.</p>
