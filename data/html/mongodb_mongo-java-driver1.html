<h2 id="support-feedback">Support / Feedback</h2>
<p>For issues with, questions about, or feedback for the MongoDB Java driver, please look into our . Please do not email any of the Java driver developers directly with issues or questions - you’re more likely to get an answer on the list on Google Groups.</p>
<p>At a minimum, please include in your description the exact version of the driver that you are using. If you are having connectivity issues, it’s often also useful to paste in the line of code where you construct the MongoClient instance, along with the values of all parameters that you pass to the constructor. You should also check your application logs for any connectivity-related exceptions and post those as well.</p>
<h2 id="bugs-feature-requests">Bugs / Feature Requests</h2>
<p>Think you’ve found a bug? Want to see a new feature in the Java driver? Please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:</p>
<ul>
<li>.</li>
<li>Navigate to .</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create Issue</strong> - Please provide as much information as possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug reports in JIRA for the driver and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are <strong>public</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other MongoDB project, please report it according to the .</p>
<h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p>Major increments (such as 2.x -&gt; 3.x) will occur when break changes are being made to the public API. All methods and classes removed in a major release will have been deprecated in a prior release of the previous major release branch, and/or otherwise called out in the release notes.</p>
<p>Minor 3.x increments (such as 3.1, 3.2, etc) will occur when non-trivial new functionality is added or significant enhancements or bug fixes occur that may have behavioral changes that may affect some edge cases (such as dependence on behavior resulting from a bug). An example of an enhancement is a method or class added to support new functionality added to the MongoDB server. Minor releases will almost always be binary compatible with prior minor releases from the same major release branch, exept as noted below.</p>
<p>Patch 3.x.y increments (such as 3.0.0 -&gt; 3.0.1, 3.1.1 -&gt; 3.1.2, etc) will occur for bug fixes only and will always be binary compitible with prior patch releases of the same minor release branch.</p>
