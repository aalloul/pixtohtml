<h1 id="castanaut-automate-your-screencasts.">Castanaut: Automate your screencasts.</h1>
<p>Author: Joseph Pearson<br />

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Castanaut lets you write executable scripts for your screencasts. With a simple dictionary of stage directions, you can create complex interactions with a variety of applications. Currently, and for the foreseeable future, Castanaut supports Mac OS X 10.5 only.</p>
<h2 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<h3 id="writing-screenplays">Writing screenplays</h3>
<p>You write your screenplays as Ruby files. Castanaut has been designed to read fairly naturally to the non-technical, within Ruby’s constraints.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple screenplay:</p>
<pre><code>launch &quot;Safari&quot;, at(10, 10, 800, 600)
type &quot;http://www.inventivelabs.com.au&quot;
hit Enter
pause 2
move to(100, 100)
move to(200, 100)
move to(200, 200)
move to(100, 200)
move to(100, 100)
say &quot;I drew a square!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>With any luck we don’t need to explain to you what this screenplay does. The only thing that might need some explanation is “say” – this has a robotic voice speak the given string. (Also: all numbers are pixel co-ordinates).</p>
<p>About the robot: no, we don’t recommend you use this in real screencasts for a large audience. Most people find it a little offputting. You are free to contravene our recommendation though. You can tweak the robot in the Mac OS X Speech Preferences pane.</p>
<h3 id="running-your-screenplay">Running your screenplay</h3>
<p>Simply give the screenplay to the castanaut command, like this:</p>
<pre><code>castanaut test.screenplay</code></pre>
<p>This assumes you have a screenplay file called “test.screenplay” in the directory where you are running the command.</p>
