<h1 id="kestrel">Kestrel</h1>
<p>Kestrel is a port of Blaine Cook’s “starling” message queue system from ruby to scala: <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/" class="uri">http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/</a></p>
<p>In Blaine’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starling is a powerful but simple messaging server that enables reliable distributed queuing with an absolutely minimal overhead. It speaks the MemCache protocol for maximum cross-platform compatibility. Any language that speaks MemCache can take advantage of Starling’s queue facilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concept of starling is to have a single server handle reliable, ordered message queues. When you put a cluster of these servers together, <em>with no cross communication</em>, and pick a server at random whenever you do a <code>set</code> or <code>get</code>, you end up with a reliable, <em>loosely ordered</em> message queue.</p>
<p>In many situations, loose ordering is sufficient. Dropping the requirement on cross communication makes it horizontally scale to infinity and beyond: no multicast, no clustering, no “elections”, no coordination at all. No talking! Shhh!</p>
<p>Kestrel adds several additional features, like ginormous queues, reliable fetch, and blocking/timeout fetch – as well as the scalability offered by actors and the JVM.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Kestrel is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fast</p>
<p>It runs on the JVM so it can take advantage of the hard work people have put into java performance.</p></li>
<li><p>small</p>
<p>Currently about 1.5K lines of scala (including comments), because it relies on Apache Mina (a rough equivalent of Danger’s ziggurat or Ruby’s EventMachine) and actors – and frankly because Scala is extremely expressive.</p></li>
<li><p>durable</p>
<p>Queues are stored in memory for speed, but logged into a journal on disk so that servers can be shutdown or moved without losing any data.</p></li>
</ul>
