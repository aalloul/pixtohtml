<p>Magpie is a small dynamically-typed programming language built around patterns, classes, and multimethods. It has a prototype interpreter that runs on the JVM and an in-progress bytecode VM written in C++.</p>
<p>It looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Generates the sequence of turns needed to draw a dragon curve.
// See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve
def dragon(0, _)
    &quot;&quot;
end

def dragon(n is Num, turn)
    dragon(n - 1, &quot;R&quot;) + turn + dragon(n - 1, &quot;L&quot;)
end

print(dragon(5, &quot;&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Its goal is to let you write code that’s beautiful and easy to read, and to allow you to seamlessly extend the language and libraries as you see fit.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the language at http://magpie-lang.org/.</p>

<p>Magpie has two implementations right now. There is a prototype interpreter written in Java. This supports more of the language, but is (of course) tied to the JVM and is <em>much</em> slower. It’s main job was to let me iterate on the language semantics quickly.</p>
<p>Now that the language has (mostly) settled down, I’ve started writing a bytecode VM in C++. This is the “real” Magpie implementation, but it’s still a work in progress. All current development is going on here. The Java interpreter is mainly a reference.</p>
