<h1 id="pwman3">PWMAN3</h1>
<p>A nice command line password manager, which can use different database to store your passwords (currently, SQLite, MySQL, and Postgresql and MongoDB are supported). Pwman3 can also copy passwords to the clipboard without exposing them! Besides managing and storing passwords, Pwman3 can also generate passwords using different algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="nice-features-in-pwman3">Nice Features in pwman3:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strong AES Encryption</li>
<li>copying of passwords to clipboard</li>
<li>launching specific uri’s with default browser</li>

<h2 id="a-very-important-note-about-security">A very important note about security</h2>
<p>If you are a concerned about security, please note: PWMAN3 is a very very basic software, which was designed to be used in a safe environment. - If you are afraid that PWMAN3 is to weak for your needs … and you still want to try it, here are a few recommendations: 1. Don’t store your Password Database in the Obvious place, and if your extremely paranoind store it completely away from your computer on a separate USB key. 2. Use a HARD to crack password to encrypt your database! - If you care, report bugs, and send patches. - I would realy like you to use PWMAN3, so I could get feedback and more ideas, especially, if you know something about security!</p>
