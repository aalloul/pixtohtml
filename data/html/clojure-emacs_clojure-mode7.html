<p>Move the current form to the closest let’s binding form. Replace all occurrences of the form in the body of the let. See demonstration on the .</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward slurp form into let</li>
</ul>
<p>Slurp the next form after the let into the let. Replace all occurrences of the bound forms in the form added to the let form. If called with a prefix argument slurp the next n forms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Backward slurp form into let</li>

<p>Slurp the form before the let into the let. Replace all occurrences of the bound forms in the form added to the let form. If called with a prefix argument slurp the previous n forms.</p>
<p><code>paredit-convolute-sexp</code> is advised to replace occurrences of bound forms with their bound names when convolute is used on a let form.</p>

<li>[clojure-mode-extra-font-locking][] provides additional font-locking for built-in methods and macros. The font-locking is pretty imprecise, because it doesn’t take namespaces into account and it won’t font-lock a function at all possible positions in a sexp, but if you don’t mind its imperfections you can easily enable it:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="el"><code>(require &#39;clojure-mode-extra-font-locking)</code></pre>
<p>The code in <code>clojure-mode-font-locking</code> used to be bundled with <code>clojure-mode</code> before version 3.0.</p>
<p>You can also use the code in this package as a basis for extending the font-locking further (e.g. functions/macros from more namespaces). Generally you should avoid adding special font-locking for things that don’t have fairly unique names, as this will result in plenty of incorrect font-locking. CIDER users should avoid this package, as CIDER does its own dynamic font-locking, which is namespace-aware and doesn’t produce almost any false positives.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[clj-refactor][] provides refactoring support.</p></li>
<li><p>Enabling <code>CamelCase</code> support for editing commands(like <code>forward-word</code>, <code>backward-word</code>, etc) in <code>clojure-mode</code> is quite useful since we often have to deal with Java class and method names. The built-in Emacs minor mode <code>subword-mode</code> provides such functionality:</p></li>
