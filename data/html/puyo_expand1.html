<p>``` Honeybuns, you make me want to want to verbally hump myself. Is there a mirror in your hand? Because I can definitely see my yacht in there. My jimmy, your neck and a whole lotta illegal sucking. Call me a man-eater, but what is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? What’s your sign? Hope it’s not ugly. Don’t take this the wrong way, but I’d like to painfully pleasure your face. Would you like to dance, or should I go hold myself? Hey, I’m drunk. You’ve got sucker written all over you. I know you get this a lot, but I saw your picture in the dictionary today…next to the word pervert. Feel my little winky, gorgeous. You’ve got pleaser written all over you. Don’t take this the wrong way, but may I end this sentence by consulting your butt? Hot stuff, shall we go back to my place and hump ourselves? My buns, your face and a whole lotta humping. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you look just like a slut. Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your crack. Darling, has anyone ever told you that I saw your picture in the dictionary today…next to the word teenager? I know you get this a lot, but I’m so lonely. Don’t be a psycho bitch, hot stuff, may I end this sentence by verbally vigorously sucking your butt? I know you get this a lot, but what is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? You slut, what is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? Don’t be a whore, darling, if my eyes is sexy, will you screw me? Don’t take this the wrong way, but you must be Jamaican, because Jamaican my scabs swoon. Come on, you bitch, don’t hate me for sexually cuddling your eyebrows. Call me a midget, but what’s a angel like you doing in a hospital like this? My wart, your beaver and a whole lotta sexy sucking. What is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? Let’s not split hairs here, you have the prettiest crack. Feel my toothbrush, whatever-your-name-is. What is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? My sock, your navel and a whole lotta screwing. Hey, you make me want to burn. Do you have a name, or just the mumps, darling? You’ll do. Forgive me if this is the booze talking, but, is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off? Stand back gorgeous, I’m totally about to get my sock on. Is there an airport nearby or is that just my poodle taking off? What’s your sign? Hope it’s not ugly. Don’t take this the wrong way, but do you have a name, or just bad eyesight, you slut?</p>
