Similarly, patches should include tests, API documentation, and an update to the manual where relevant. Feel free to send a pull request early though, if you just want some feedback or a code review before preparing your code to be merged.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about whether or not you’ve found a bug, or want to check to see whether we’d be interested in the feature you want to add before you start working on it, feel free to post to our mailing list.</p>

<li>Running <code>rspec -t unresolved</code> will run <em>only</em> unresolved issues</li>
<li>Running <code>rspec -t issue:NUMBER</code> will run the tests for a specific issue</li>
</ol>
<p>These filters make it possible for us to add failing test cases for bugs that are currently being researched or worked on, without breaking the typical full</p>
