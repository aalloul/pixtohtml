<h1 id="tofublox">TofuBlox</h1>
<p>It’s a tumbleblogemess. It’s a app. It scratches an itch for me.</p>
<p>TofuBlox is to a CMS as tofu is to chicken: more fun, and better for you and the chicken.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>You can easily retrieve all the requirements to run TofuBlox if you download it by using <code>git clone</code>. Inside the top TofuBlox directory, run this command:</p>
<pre><code>git submodule update --init</code></pre>
<p>If you downloaded TofuBlox as a compressed file or in some other fashion, the easiest way to get its requirements are by installing Ruby gems. You can install the needed gems with these commands:</p>
<pre><code>gem install ramaze sequel bacon
gem install crnixon-active_files --source http://gems.github.com</code></pre>
<p>If you want to hack on TofuBlox, you’ll want the following gems:</p>
<ul>
<li>rcov</li>
<li>mocha</li>
<li>reek</li>
</ul>
<p>They are not included by default, but can be obtained with the command:</p>
<pre><code>gem install rcov mocha reek</code></pre>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Clone the git repository (git://github.com/crnixon/tofublox.git) or download a tarball and expand it. This should be ready to run, but you’ll want to customize it. You should pay attention to the files below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config/tofu_config.rb</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can set the default title for your site here, as well as the password to log into the admin section.</p>
<p>To run TofuBlox in development mode, run <code>ruby start.rb</code>. TofuBlox uses .</p>
<h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>
<p>When you start TofuBlox, the home page will be blank and you will not know what to do. Go to http://wherever.you.are.running.this/admin. You will be prompted via HTTP Basic authentication for a username and password. The password is whatever you have set up in <code>config/tofu_config.rb</code>. You can type whatever you like for the username. This username will be used as the author when you create new blocks.</p>
<p><em>Blocks</em> are what most blog systems call “posts” and what most CMSes call “pages.” They are called blocks because you can set up many <em>molds,</em> or definitions of blocks. By pouring content into these molds, you can make new blocks.</p>
<p>The admin screens should be pretty self-explanatory, but if they are not, let me know!</p>
<h2 id="molds">Molds</h2>
<p>Molds are kept in text files under the <code>molds/</code> directory. They are pretty simple: they’re a YAML file with one or two templates underneath, like this:</p>
