<h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>
<p>Now that you have a vague idea of what youâ€™re about to get into you might just want to get a way to get up and running ASAP. Please read below for more information about installation.</p>
<p>Depending on what you are planning to do you can either just go and start reading the source or directly get some hands-on experience by trying some of the examples. Most things will require dependencies though. The basic functionality is provided by the WEBrick adapter and the Template::Ramaze, which just run out of the box. For more features you will have to install some templating-engines and mongrel (<em>very</em> recommended). Ramaze will inform you when it needs further dependencies, so just go and try some things.</p>
<p>Some places to get started are: - Read the documentation. - Run and read the test cases. - Look at the examples and run/modify them.</p>
<h1 id="a-couple-of-examples">A couple of Examples</h1>
<p>There are some examples for your instant pleasure inside the examples-directory in the Ramaze-distribution. To start up an example, you can use the Ramaze binary located in bin/ramaze</p>
