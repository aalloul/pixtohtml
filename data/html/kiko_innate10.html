<p>Gestalt has been the first “templating engine” for Ramaze and is still used in some fractions of the code and various applications. There are a lot of other html/xml builders out there these days so I think this is no good choice for inclusion into Innate. I will keep it inside Ramaze.</p>
<h3 id="ramazestoredefault">Ramaze::Store::Default</h3>
<p>This has been removed from Innate and Ramaze. It started out as a simple wrapper for YAML::Store to make the tutorial easier, but I think it gives a wrong impression of being anything else.</p>
<p>It’s very slow, might raise exceptions under heavy load and a plain YAML::Store or PStore or any other persistence mechanism is generally a better choice, so there is no need to keep this around.</p>
<h3 id="contrib">Contrib</h3>
<p>Ramaze has some things in contrib, some of them used widely, others not at all.</p>
<p>I’m still going through these, putting what is suitable for a wider audience into rack-contrib, including what fits into the Ramaze concept into Ramaze, but none of these will find its way into Innate.</p>
<p>One exception, the file cache has been added to Innate already and the sequel cache is in Ramaze proper.</p>
<p>The gzip filter has a more powerful and better maintained equivalent in Rack::Deflater.</p>
<p>The profiling hook is obsolete as well, there is an equivalent in rack-contrib.</p>
<p>The emailer is really light-weight and but lacks support for many things you will need, I’m working on a new Helper::Email that integrates with Mailit (a fork of MailFactory).</p>
<p>Things I’ll not touch for now are <code>facebook</code> and <code>gettext</code>.</p>
<p>The sequel related stuff will have to be removed and might find a place somewhere else, (somebody start a sequel-contrib already!).</p>
<p>The <code>gems</code> was refactored and put into <code>ramaze/setup.rb</code>, where it provides you with painless first-start experience.</p>
<h3 id="adapters">Adapters</h3>
<p>These are entirely the responsibility of Rack/Innate now, Ramaze doesn’t need to worry about that. WEBrick will remain the default adapter since it is in the</p>
