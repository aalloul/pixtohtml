<pre><code>
Transformations are now slightly restricted in their return values: a node or
a collection of nodes (instead of freely nested collections of nodes).

Dynamic selectors: selectors aren&#39;t compiled anymore. It means that you don&#39;t
need to wrap them in `(selector ...)` forms anymore nor to eval them in the most
dynamic cases.

Fragment selectors allow to select adjacent nodes. They are denoted by a map of
two node selectors (eg `{[:h1] [:p]}`), bounds are inclusive and they select
the smallest matching fragments.

Transformations (the right-hand parts of rules) are now plain old closures.
These functions take one arg (the selected node) and return nil, another node
or a collection of nodes.

Rules are applied top-down: the first rule transforms the whole tree and the
resulting tree is passed to the next rules.

Nodes are transformed deep-first, that is: if a selector selects several nodes,
descendants are transformed first. Hence, when the transformation is applied to
an ancestor, you can &quot;see&quot; the transformed descendants (but you can not see
your transformed siblings).

<p>/B /(T B) A if A and B are selected and transformed by T the the resulting tree is (T A )  ```</p>

<p><code>snippet</code> is a unit of your page. It may be logical or visual entry, such as header, footer, page element. Snippet is usually a part of a <code>template</code>, and may serve as a container for other snippets. For example, for navigation on the web page. For that, letâ€™s first define an html template for the navigation. Snippets are created by using <code>net.cgrand.enlive-html/defsnippet</code> function and, same as templates, they require a corresponding HTML template file to be availble in a classpath.</p>
<p>So, <code>snippet</code> function returns a seq of nodes, it can be used as a building block for more complex templates.</p>
<p><code>templates</code> combine snippets together, they serve like a basement for</p>
