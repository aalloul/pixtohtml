<p>manual entry, with no access to the source of tcpdump or etherfind.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, tcpdump has been steadily improved by the excellent contributions from the Internet community (just browse through the <code>CHANGES</code> file). We are grateful for all the input.</p>
<p>Richard Stevens gives an excellent treatment of the Internet protocols in his book <em>“TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1”</em>. If you want to learn more about tcpdump and how to interpret its output, pick up this book.</p>
<p>Some tools for viewing and analyzing tcpdump trace files are available from the Internet Traffic Archive:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://www.sigcomm.org/ITA/</li>
</ul>
<p>Another tool that tcpdump users might find useful is tcpslice:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpslice</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a program that can be used to extract portions of tcpdump binary trace files. See the above distribution for further details and documentation.</p>
<p>Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, etc. should be sent to the address “tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org”. Bugs, support requests, and feature requests may also be submitted on the GitHub issue tracker for tcpdump at:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Source code contributions, etc. should be sent to the email address above or submitted by forking the branch on GitHub at:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/tree/master</li>
</ul>
<p>and issuing a pull request.</p>
<p>Current versions can be found at www.tcpdump.org.</p>
