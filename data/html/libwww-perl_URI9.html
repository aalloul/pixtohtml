<h1 id="scheme-specific-support">SCHEME-SPECIFIC SUPPORT</h1>
<p>Scheme-specific support is provided for the following URI schemes. For <code>URI</code> objects that do not belong to one of these, you can only use the common and generic methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>data</strong>:</p>
<p>The <em>data</em> URI scheme is specified in RFC 2397. It allows inclusion of small data items as “immediate” data, as if it had been included externally.</p>
<p><code>URI</code> objects belonging to the data scheme support the common methods and two new methods to access their scheme-specific components: $uri-&gt;media_type and $uri-&gt;data. See for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>file</strong>:</p>
<p>An old specification of the <em>file</em> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738. A new RFC 2396 based specification in not available yet, but file URI references are in common use.</p>
<p><code>URI</code> objects belonging to the file scheme support the common and generic methods. In addition, they provide two methods for mapping file URIs back to local file names; $uri-&gt;file and $uri-&gt;dir. See for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ftp</strong>:</p>
<p>An old specification of the <em>ftp</em> URI scheme is found in RFC 1738. A new RFC 2396 based specification in not available yet, but ftp URI references are in common use.</p>
<p><code>URI</code> objects belonging to the ftp scheme support the common, generic and server methods. In addition, they provide two methods for accessing the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gt;user and $uri-&gt;password.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>gopher</strong>:</p>
<p>The <em>gopher</em> URI scheme is specified in &lt;draft-murali-url-gopher-1996-12-04&gt; and will hopefully be available as a RFC 2396 based specification.</p>
<p><code>URI</code> objects belonging to the gopher scheme support the common, generic and server methods. In addition, they support some methods for</p></li>
