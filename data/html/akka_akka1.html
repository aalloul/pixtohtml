<h1 id="akka">Akka</h1>
<p>We believe that writing correct concurrent &amp; distributed, resilient and elastic applications is too hard. Most of the time it’s because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Akka is here to change that.</p>
<p>Using the Actor Model we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications. This model is a perfect match for the principles laid out in the .</p>
<p>For resilience, we adopt the “Let it crash” model which the telecom industry has used with great success to build applications that self-heal and systems that never stop.</p>
<p>Actors also provide the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault-tolerant applications.</p>
