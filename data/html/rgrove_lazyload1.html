<h1 id="lazyload">LazyLoad</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> LazyLoad is no longer being maintained. I’m not responding to issues or pull requests, since I don’t use this project anymore and don’t have time to work on it. Please feel free to fork it if you want to continue development on it.</p>
<p>LazyLoad is a tiny (only 966 bytes minified and gzipped), dependency-free JavaScript utility that makes it super easy to load external JavaScript and CSS files on demand.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, LazyLoad will automatically load resources in parallel while ensuring execution order when you specify an array of URLs to load. In browsers that don’t preserve the execution order of asynchronously-loaded scripts, LazyLoad will safely load the scripts sequentially.</p>
<p>Use LazyLoad when you need a small, fast, safe dynamic JS or CSS loader, but don’t need the overhead of dependency management or other extra functionality that larger script loaders provide.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Using LazyLoad is simple. Just call the appropriate method – <code>css()</code> to load CSS, <code>js()</code> to load JavaScript – and pass in a URL or array of URLs to load. You can also provide a callback function if you’d like to be notified when the resources have finished loading, as well as an argument to pass to the callback and a context in which to execute the callback.</p>
<p>```js // Load a single JavaScript file and execute a callback when it finishes. LazyLoad.js(‘http://example.com/foo.js’, function () { alert(‘foo.js has been loaded’); });</p>
<p>// Load multiple JS files and execute a callback when they’ve all finished. LazyLoad.js([‘foo.js’, ‘bar.js’, ‘baz.js’], function () { alert(‘all files have been loaded’); });</p>
<p>// Load a CSS file and pass an argument to the callback function. LazyLoad.css(‘foo.css’, function (arg) { alert(arg); }, ‘foo.css has been loaded’);</p>
<p>// Load a CSS file and execute the callback in a different scope. LazyLoad.css(‘foo.css’, function () {</p>
