<body>
<p>Declares that the expected message is never sent. <code>at_least</code> / <code>at_most</code> modifiers are allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>times(<em>n</em>)</b></p>
<p>Declares that the expected message is sent <em>n</em> times. <code>at_least</code> / <code>at_most</code> modifiers are allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>at_least</b></p>
<p>Modifies the immediately following message count constraint so that it means the message is sent at least that number of times. E.g. <code>at_least.once</code> means the message is sent at least once during the test, but may be sent more often. Both <code>at_least</code> and <code>at_most</code> may be specified on the same expectation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>at_most</b></p>
<p>Similar to <code>at_least</code>, but puts an upper limit on the number of messages. Both <code>at_least</code> and <code>at_most</code> may be specified on the same expectation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ordered</b></p>
<p>Declares that the expected message is ordered and is expected to be received in a certain position in a sequence of messages. The message should arrive after and previously declared ordered messages and prior to any following declared ordered messages. Unordered messages are ignored when considering the message order.</p>
<p>Normally ordering is performed only against calls in the same mock object. If the “globally” adjective is used, then ordering is performed against the other globally ordered method calls.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ordered(<em>group</em>)</b></p>
<p>Declare that the expected message belongs to an order group. Methods within an order group may be received in any order. Ordered messages outside the group must be received either before or after all of the grouped messages.</p>
<p>For example, in the following, messages <code>flip</code> and <code>flop</code> may be received in any order (because they are in the same group), but must occur strictly after <code>start</code> but before <code>end</code>. The message <code>any_time</code> may be received at any time because it is not ordered.</p></li>
</ul>
