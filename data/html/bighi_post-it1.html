<p>Post-it Documentation</p>
<p><strong>Warning: This project hasn’t been updated in a LONG time. I don’t even know if it works anymore. At least it may help someone learn something.</strong></p>

<p>=== INSTALATION ===</p>
<p>To use this plugin in your project, it should be declared as a component on your controller. You can declare it inside your controller like this:</p>
<pre><code>var $components = array(&#39;Postit.Postit&#39;);</code></pre>
<p>If you want this component in ALL your controllers, just add the code above to your app_controller.php</p>
<p>You can access this components through $this-&gt;Postit inside your controller.</p>
<p>=== USAGE ===</p>
<p>To use this plugin, you should call $this-&gt;Postit, passing all parameters as chained methods (see below). You ALWAYS need to call upload() method last. If you do not call it, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;Postit-&gt;image(&quot;avatar&quot;)-&gt;size(&quot;160x320&quot;)-&gt;save_to(&quot;avatars&quot;)-&gt;upload();</code></pre>
<p>All parameters are called after $this-&gt;Postit, and separated by the arrow -&gt;</p>
<p>The only parameters not optional are IMAGE() and UPLOAD().</p>
<p>If a param has an alias, you can call its alias instead of the real name. You can see below that image() param has an alias called picture. So you can call it image() or picture() and the result is the same.</p>
<p>See below all parameters available and their aliases.</p>
<p>=== SPECIAL NOTE: MAXIMIZATION ===</p>
<p>Both main picture and thumbnail have their ‘maximization’ variable set to false. What does it mean?</p>
<p>If you set the desired size (lets say ‘300x300’) and you have an image with size 400x270, then its width will be reduced to 300, and its height WILL STAY 270. Why does it happen? Maximization!</p>
<p>When you set image size, you are telling the plugin what’s the biggest size you want. If width or height of the image is SMALLER then the size you passed, it will not change if maximization if OFF (set to false).</p>
<p>There are params that set image maximization to ON (set to true). When it’s on, and you informed a size bigger than 0, than this size will always expand to the desired size. So, in the example aboxe, the picture width will be reduced to 300, and its height will be expanded to 300.</p>
<p>Never forget maximization when using this plugin.</p>
