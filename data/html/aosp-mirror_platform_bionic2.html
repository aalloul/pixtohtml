<p>libc/ arch-arm/ arch-arm64/ arch-common/ arch-mips/ arch-mips64/ arch-x86/ arch-x86_64/ # Each architecture has its own subdirectory for stuff that isn’t shared # because it’s architecture-specific. There will be a .mk file in here that # drags in all the architecture-specific files. bionic/ # Every architecture needs a handful of machine-specific assembler files. # They live here. include/ machine/ # The majority of header files are actually in libc/include/, but many # of them pull in a &lt;machine/something.h&gt; for things like limits, # endianness, and how floating point numbers are represented. Those # headers live here. string/ # Most architectures have a handful of optional assembler files # implementing optimized versions of various routines. The &lt;string.h&gt; # functions are particular favorites. syscalls/ # The syscalls directories contain script-generated assembler files. # See ‘Adding system calls’ later.</p>
<p>include/ # The public header files on everyone’s include path. These are a mixture of # files written by us and files taken from BSD.</p>
<p>kernel/ # The kernel uapi header files. These are scrubbed copies of the originals # in external/kernel-headers/. These files must not be edited directly. The # generate_uapi_headers.sh script should be used to go from a kernel tree to # external/kernel-headers/ — this takes care of the architecture-specific # details. The update_all.py script should be used to regenerate bionic’s # scrubbed headers from external/kernel-headers/.</p>
<p>private/ # These are private header files meant for use within bionic itself.</p>
