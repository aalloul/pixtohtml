<p>The available package generators for cmake are a little different on different platforms. It is usually best to generate binary packages on their native platforms.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/build/hypertable
~/src/hypertable/bin/src-utils/htpkg generator...</code></pre>
<p>where generator can be DEB (for debian packages), RPM (for redhat/fedora/centos packages), PackageMaker (for Mac OS X packages) and STGZ (for self extracting gzipped tar files.) etc. See cpack(1) for more options.</p>
<p>For every generator listed on the command line, the above command will generate two packages: one for the entire hypertable distribution and one for thriftbroker only.</p>
<p>You can also use htbuild to generate binary packages on remote machines that are not setup for development, even a base Amazon EC2 image:</p>
<pre><code>~/src/hypertable/bin/src-utils/htbuild --ami ami-5946a730 DEB RPM TBZ2</code></pre>
<p>At the moment, I recommend an Ubuntu/Debian machine for generating binary packages as it can generate both RPM and DEB correctly faster without having to disable prelinking and selinux like on Fedora/Redhat.</p>

<li><p>Make sure software is built and installed according to “HOW TO BUILD FROM SOURCE”</p></li>
<li><p>Run the regression tests</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/build/hypertable
make alltests</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: there are two other high-level test targets: coretests (for core tests) and moretests (for more longer running tests, which is included in alltests.) These high-level test targets will (re)start test servers automatically when new servers are installed. There is also a low-level “test” target in root of the build tree and src (and src/lang/Components) and tests/integration directories that does NOT auto restart test servers.</p>
