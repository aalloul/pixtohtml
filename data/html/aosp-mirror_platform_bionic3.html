<p>upstream-freebsd/ upstream-netbsd/ upstream-openbsd/ # These directories contain unmolested upstream source. Any time we can # just use a BSD implementation of something unmodified, we should. # The structure under these directories mimics the upstream tree, # but there’s also… android/ include/ # This is where we keep the hacks necessary to build BSD source # in our world. The *-compat.h files are automatically included # using -include, but we also provide equivalents for missing # header/source files needed by the BSD implementation.</p>
<p>bionic/ # This is the biggest mess. The C++ files are files we own, typically # because the Linux kernel interface is sufficiently different that we # can’t use any of the BSD implementations. The C files are usually # legacy mess that needs to be sorted out, either by replacing it with # current upstream source in one of the upstream directories or by # switching the file to C++ and cleaning it up.</p>
<p>malloc_debug/ # The code that implements the functionality to enable debugging of # native allocation problems.</p>
<p>stdio/ # These are legacy files of dubious provenance. We’re working to clean # this mess up, and this directory should disappear.</p>

tzcode/ # A modified superset of the IANA tzcode. Most of the modifications relate # to Android’s use of a single file (with corresponding index) to contain # time zone data. zoneinfo/ # Android-format time zone data. # See ‘Updating tzdata’ later.
