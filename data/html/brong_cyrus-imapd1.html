<h1 id="what-is-cyrus">What is Cyrus</h1>
<p>Cyrus is an IMAP server, where IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a protocol for accessing mail.</p>
<p>The Cyrus IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it is generally intended to be run on “sealed” servers, where normal users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail is through the IMAP, NNTP, or POP3 protocols.</p>
<p>The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administrability. Multiple concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox hierarchies.</p>
<h1 id="cyrus-goals">Cyrus goals</h1>
