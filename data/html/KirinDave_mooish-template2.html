<pre><code>$&gt; ruby build.rb Core JsonP MyRadClassIsTight</code></pre>
<p>Notice that all three of the supplied dependencies are from different libraries (Mootools-core, Clientcide and fake respectively). Since all three have <code>scripts.json</code> files that link each other up, the build will produce a file with those three classes concatenated along with all of their dependencies.</p>
<p>This really comes in handy for building custom Javascript lib files for your projects. For example, my site www.iancollins.me uses classes from Mootools, Clientcide and Brawndo™. I have a one-line file “3n” with this inside of it:</p>
<pre><code>JsonP Date Date.Extras JustTheTip Number.BrawndoExtras Function.BrawndoExtras 
Element.BrawndoScrolling Element.BrawndoExtras Element.BrawndoImage 
Element.BrawndoStyles Element.BrawndoDisplaying params String.BrawndoExtras 
Array.BrawndoExtras dbug TwitterHelpers RandomGlobals DomReady 
CSSTransitions.Tween</code></pre>
<p>Now to build all the necessary lib js you simple do:</p>
<pre><code>ruby build.rb &lt;($3n)</code></pre>
<h3 id="builder.yml">builder.yml</h3>
<p>This is a YAML defining paths to all of the project’s <code>scripts.json</code> files that you want depend on for this project.</p>
<h3 id="source">Source/</h3>
<p>This is where your code lives. There is a dummy directory and file as an example, these can be deleted. Each class or set of extensions should be in its own file, in a directory that makes sense for what it does.</p>
<h3 id="sourcescripts.json">Source/scripts.json</h3>
<p>This is a JSON representation of your code inside Source - <strong>you</strong> keep this file up-to-date. It has an accurate representation of the code provided in /Source, with dependencies from Mootools-core.</p>
<h3 id="specs">Specs/</h3>
<p>This is a basic Screw.Unit setup for your specs. Delete this is you’d rather use JSSpec or some other crazy framework I don’t know about. For help on adding tests here look at the first part of “3.” under the header “Adding your code”.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests/</h3>
<p>This is a basic [Mootool Unit Test Framework][3] setup for your interactive tests. For help on adding tests here look at the second part of “3.” under the header “Adding your code”.</p>
