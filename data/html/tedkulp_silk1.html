<h1 id="silk-framework">Silk Framework</h1>
<p>The Silk Framework is a PHP 5.3+, MVC web framework which was originally taken from CMS Made Simple 2.0, but has been reworked many times since then.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Silk tries to do as much as it needs to and nothing more. The focus is resting squarely on being the plumbing of a web application, without handling anything that requires configuration or would act differently for every application.</p>
<ul>
<li>MVC based workflow w/ sensible defaults</li>
<li>Intelligent route handling</li>
<li>Doctrine2 ORM w/ many databases supported</li>
<li>Seamless MongoDB support (<strong>coming soon</strong>)</li>
<li>Easily exandable w/ extensions</li>
<li>Extensible form API w/ smart defaults and workflow</li>
<li>Built on a library similar to for easy middleware-based expandability</li>
<li>Unit testing w/ built-in</li>
<li></li>
<li>Command line focused workflow with easily added commands via simple PHP scripts.</li>
<li>caching system (memcached, memory, xcache, apc, database) (<strong>coming soon</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-kind-of-stuff-doesnt-it-do">What kind of stuff doesn’t it do?</h3>
<p>Things below are the types of things Silk won’t do. Since it’s easily expandable via extensions, it becomes unnecessary to handle things that will have too many options. Things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users/Groups</li>
<li>Permissions/Authentication</li>
</ul>
<p>Please don’t submit features/issues with stuff that’s too high level. I’ll just tell you make an extension. k?thx!</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3+</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="recommended">Recommended</h3>
