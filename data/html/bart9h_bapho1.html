<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>Keeping your photos is a very long term business. You don’t want to invest time to organize your photos just to have the software you relied on to stop working, (you moved to a different system where it is not available, it stopped being maintained or supported, etc).</p>
<p>I tried some photo managers, but I was always wary of committing to a specific software. Of course, if I choose an open source software, I could code a export/import tool if I decide to switch to another one. But I also didn’t want to commit to a specific layout for the folders, or a database for the metadata. What I really want, and fell it’s the Right Thing To Do, it’s to just use the filesystem. None did that, so I decided to create my own.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can rename or rearrange the folders or photos any way you like, because:</p></li>
<li>Everything is in the file system:
<ul>
<li>All metadata (rating, tags, etc) is kept in a simple text file alongside the image files.</li>
<li>Unixy extensibility: easy to do complex operations using your file manager or command line tools.</li>
<li>Don’t rely on databases: the data will still be useful even without BaPhO.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simple on-screen-display, keyboard driven interface.
<ul>
<li>[planned, currently only uses wheel to navigate] Mouse works too.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Handles multiple files of the same photo.
<ul>
<li>[planned] Pick which version to display (currently it uses the most recently modified).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Import tool automatically copy (or move) photos to a folder structure based on EXIF date/time.</p></li>
</ul>
