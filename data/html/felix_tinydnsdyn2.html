<p>An example Makefile is included with some ideas.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Start the service by symlinking this directory into your svscan directory (i.e. “ln $(pwd) /etc/service/” ).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="client">Client</h3>
<p>The service operates over HTTP and should be reasonably close to the service operated by DynDns.com having the following request format:</p>
<p>http://username:password@yourdnsserver.com/?hostname=yourhostname&amp;myip=optionaladdress</p>
<p>The only required parameter is the hostname you wish to change. This can be a comma separated list of hostnames to update. The IP address will be determined automatically if the ‘myip’ parameter is missing.</p>
<p>The response codes are taken from here (not all of them):</p>
<p>http://www.dyndns.com/developers/specs/return.html</p>
<p>The Python code is basic and inefficient but it should work. I take no responsibility for anything that may happen to any of your machines. That said, please let me know if there are any issues.</p>
