<h1 id="lg-live-look---view-entries-in-template-context-from-the-expressionengine-control-panel-publish-tab-and-edit-entry-table.">LG Live Look - View entries in template context from the ExpressionEngine control panel publish tab and edit entry table.</h1>
<p>LG Live Look is a [Multi-Site Manager][ee_msm] compatible[ ExpressionEngine extension][ee_cp_extensions_manager] that allows you to view the latest published revision of an entry in the ExpressionEngine [control panel][ee_cp].</p>
<p>When enabled, a Live Look tab is added to the CP publish form which displays the entry in a rendered template context. Additionally Live Look links are added to the CP [edit entries table][ee_cp_edit].</p>
<p>But that’s not all; When installed along side [NSM Publish Plus][nsm_publish_plus], LG Live Look adds the ability to preview unpublished entries, drafts and revisions in template context.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>ExpressionEngine implemented ‘Live Look’ entry previews in version 1.6.1. While a welcome addition, it didn’t quite match my development workflow.</p>
<p>IMHO, problems with the native Live Look are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom urls are not allowed which forces you to use <code>/template_group/template/entry_id/</code>. Being forced to use the <code>entry_id</code> doesn’t suit my site which uses custom url formats including the {url_title} parameter.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support urls generated by the Pages &amp; Structure modules.</li>
<li>There is no way to view the entry in the Publish Form.</li>
<li>The third issue, which isn’t related to the native Live Look (but is a general entry ‘preview’ issue), is there is no way to preview updates to an existing entry before it is “live” even using conventional status work arounds. NSM Publish Plus provides the functionality to save drafts without affecting the current live version. LG Live look integrates with NSM Publish plus to provide draft preview in template context.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>LG Live Look has many features to enhance your publishing workflow. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publish Form Live Look tab</strong> - View published entry revisions in template context from the CP publish form. Previewing unpublished changes to entries, viewing drafts and revisions requires NSM Publish Plus.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Page Live Look links</strong> - Quick navigation to the live entry from the edit entries table.</li>
<li><strong>Hide default preview box</strong> - Remove the standard ExpressionEngine entry preview.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSM Publish Plus compatible</strong> - Real template powered entry previews, drafts and revisions!</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Site Manager compatible</strong> - Independent extension settings for each site</li>
<li><strong>LG Addon Updater compatible</strong> - Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of LG Live Look</li>
</ul>
