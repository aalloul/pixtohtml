<p>Burgess (1996).</p>
<p>The default value for this is “0”, meaning that variance will not be used. If it is set to “1”, it must be enabled at the time of creation of the co-occurrence database. It will not work with databases created with versions of HiDEx before version 0.06, or with new databases that were not created with useVariance = 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>2I) How do I improve the performance of HiDEx? ****************************************************************************</p>
<p>The simplest way to improve performance is to run HiDEx on a computer with more CPUs and faster CPUs, more memory and faster disk. Make sure to use OpenMP, and set the number of threads equal to the number of cores available.</p>
<p>Certain configuration options have a very strong influence on the performance of HiDEx. Here is a summary of the most important ones:</p>
<p>Lexicon Size: The larger the lexicon, the larger the matrix (Each extra word in the lexicon adds an extra dimension to the representation). A lexicon with double the number of words in it can cause a 400% increase in storage space needed for the raw co-occurrence data. Also, the lexicon size will increase the size of the GCM, which will slow down all metric calculations. I normally use a lexicon of around 50,000 words in size.</p>
<p>maxWindowBehind and maxWindowAhead: Large values for these variable will greatly slow down the processing of the corpus and the aggregation of the GCM.</p>
<p>stepsize: This is a memory-usage tuning setting, and must be set carefully. During corpus processing, large amounts of data must be kept in RAM. There is no way that I know to predict the sparseness of the database, and that means there is no way to predict the memory usage of HiDEx when processing a corpus. The default setting is very conservative, and should work for computers that have 4Gb of RAM. If you have more RAM than 4Gb, please try larger values, but be careful to monitor the memory usage of the HiDEx process. If HiDEx tries to use more memory than your computer has, it will begin using virtual memory (and cause enormous amounts of swapping) and your corpus processing will take months instead of hours.</p>
<p>contextSize: The larger the context size, the greater the memory usage, and the greater the computation required. I recommend using context sizes of 10,000 or greater.</p>
