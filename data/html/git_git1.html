<h1 id="git---fast-scalable-distributed-revision-control-system">Git - fast, scalable, distributed revision control system</h1>
<p>Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.</p>
<p>Git is an Open Source project covered by the GNU General Public License version 2 (some parts of it are under different licenses, compatible with the GPLv2). It was originally written by Linus Torvalds with help of a group of hackers around the net.</p>
<p>Please read the file [INSTALL][] for installation instructions.</p>
<p>Many Git online resources are accessible from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="uri">https://git-scm.com/</a> including full documentation and Git related tools.</p>
<p>See [Documentation/gittutorial.txt][] to get started, then see [Documentation/giteveryday.txt][] for a useful minimum set of commands, and Documentation/git-<commandname>.txt for documentation of each command. If git has been correctly installed, then the tutorial can also be read with <code>man gittutorial</code> or <code>git help tutorial</code>, and the documentation of each command with <code>man git-&lt;commandname&gt;</code> or <code>git help &lt;commandname&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>CVS users may also want to read [Documentation/gitcvs-migration.txt][] (<code>man gitcvs-migration</code> or <code>git help cvs-migration</code> if git is installed).</p>
<p>The user discussion and development of Git take place on the Git mailing list – everyone is welcome to post bug reports, feature requests, comments and patches to git@vger.kernel.org (read [Documentation/SubmittingPatches][] for instructions on patch submission). To subscribe to the list, send an email with just “subscribe git” in the body to majordomo@vger.kernel.org. The mailing list archives are available at <a href="https://public-inbox.org/git/" class="uri">https://public-inbox.org/git/</a>, <a href="http://marc.info/?l=git" class="uri">http://marc.info/?l=git</a> and other archival sites.</p>
<p>The maintainer frequently sends the “What’s cooking” reports that list the current status of various development topics to the mailing list. The discussion following them give a good reference for project status, development direction and remaining tasks.</p>
<p>The name “git” was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as “the stupid content tracker” and the name as (depending on your mood):</p>
<ul>
<li>random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of “get” may or may not be relevant.</li>
</ul>
