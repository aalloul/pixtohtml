<p>details on how to add customizations to the kit.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-starter-kit">Getting the Starter Kit</h2>
<p>You have two choices. You can <a href="https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit/archive/master.zip">download a <code>.zip</code> file of the kit</a>. This will give you a static snapshot of the most recent version. But if you want to keep up with changes to the kit, you should clone the source code using git rather than simply copying a static version of it. You should be using version control on your plain-text documents anyway, so I recommend this second option.</p>
<p><strong>0.1 Get Emacs</strong>. The starter kit requires Emacs 24.4 (released October 2014). <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/" title="GNU Emacs For Mac OS X">Download Emacs here</a>. Alternatively, if you are comfortable with Homebrew, compile and install it.</p>
<p><strong>0.2 Install a Modern TeX Distribution and the Skim PDF reader</strong>. If you are using OS X, <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/" title="MacTeX - TeX Users Group">download MacTeX here</a> and install it. The kit is set up to use the <a href="http://skim-app.sourceforge.net">Skim PDF reader</a> to display PDF files created from <code>.tex</code> files. You can use other readers, but will need to modify the setup in the <code>starter-kit-latex.org</code> file.</p>
<p><strong>0.3 Install R and Pandoc</strong>. These are not strictly required for the installation to work, and you can skip this step if you like. But you will probably be using them anyway, if you’re not already. If you’re doing statistical work you will probably want to use R or Stata. R is free and you can . Pandoc is a very useful utility that lets you convert easily between many different forms of plain-text markup (such as Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, and others). .</p>
<p><strong>0.4 Note your user name</strong> or the name of your computer. If you don’t know either, open the Terminal application and do</p>
<pre><code>$ whoami</code></pre>
<p>for your user name and</p>
<pre><code>$ hostname</code></pre>
<p>for the system name. You will need to know your login name to activate the final customization file properly. You can use the system name as well (or instead).</p>
