<p>Simple bridge between base ClearCase or UCM and Git.</p>
<h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>
<p>I wrote this purely for fun and to see if I could stop use ClearCase at work once and for all.</p>
<p>I will probably continue to hack away at it to suite my needs, but I would love to see it get some real-world polish. (Actually what I would love to see more is for ClearCase to die, but don’t think that’s going to happen any time soon).</p>
<p>Suggestions on anything I’ve done are more than welcome.</p>
<p>Also, I have made a change recently to support adding binary files which uses git-cat. Unfortunately git-cat doesn’t handle end line conversions and so I have made gitcc init set core.autocrlf to false. This is only relevant for Windows users. Don’t try changing this after your first commit either as it will only make matters worse. My apologies to anyone that is stung by this.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to install git-cc, is to use the Python package installer pip and install it directly from its GitHub repo. Execute the following command on the command prompt to install the latest version:</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt; pip install git+git://github.com/charleso/git-cc.git#egg=git_cc</code></pre>
<p>If you installed Python from python.org, pip is included with Python 2 &gt;= 2.7.9 and Python 3 &gt;= 3.4. If you do not have pip, [this section] [pip-installation] from the Python Packaging User Guide describes how to install it.</p>
<p>In case pip or git cannot reach GitHub, for example when such access is not allowed in the place where you work, you can download the [zip file] [zip-file] with the latest version from the GitHub repo. Unzip it and use pip to execute the following command in the root of the directory tree:</p>
<pre><code>C:\master&gt; pip install .</code></pre>
<p>Finally, if you cannot use pip, you can also use the old-skool approach to install Python packages:</p>
<pre><code>C:\master&gt; python setup.py install</code></pre>
