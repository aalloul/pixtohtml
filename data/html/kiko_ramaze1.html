<h1 id="about-ramaze">About Ramaze</h1>
<p>Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework. The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible.</p>
<p>This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve perfect custom-tailored results.</p>
<p>Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as modular and therefor reusable as possible, not only to provide a basic understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible to reuse parts of the code.</p>
<p>The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural layout of the resulting framework.</p>
<h2 id="quick-example">Quick Example</h2>
<p>While Ramaze applications are usually spread across multiple directories for controllers, models and views one can quite easily create a very basic application in just a single file:</p>
<pre><code>require &#39;ramaze&#39;

class MyController &lt; Ramaze::Controller
  map &#39;/&#39;
  
  def index
    &quot;Hello, Ramaze!&quot;
  end
end  

Ramaze.start</code></pre>
<p>Once this is saved in a file (you can also run this from IRB) simply execute it using the Ruby binary:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby hello_ramaze.rb</code></pre>
<p>This starts a WEBRick server listening on localhost:7000.</p>
