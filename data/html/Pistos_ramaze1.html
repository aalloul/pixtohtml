<h1 id="about-ramaze">About Ramaze</h1>
<p>Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework. The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible.</p>
<p>This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve perfect custom-tailored results.</p>
<p>Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as modular and therefor reusable as possible, not only to provide a basic understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible to reuse parts of the code.</p>
<p>The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural layout of the resulting framework.</p>
<h1 id="features-overview">Features Overview</h1>
<p>Ramaze offers following features at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adapters</p>
<p>Ramaze takes advantage of the rack library to provide a common way of handling different ways to serve its content.</p>
<p>Rack supports at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for hosting Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than FastCGI or SCGI.</p></li>
<li><p>WEBrick is a Ruby library program to build HTTP servers.</p></li>
<li><p>CGI</p>
<p>CGI is the Common Gateway Interface and is one of the most basic ways to integrate into Webservers like Apache or Lighttpd.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
