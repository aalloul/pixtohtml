<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>PowerDNS is a reliable alternative to BIND and sports a flexible, feature rich design and support for various backends, including MySQL and PostgreSQL. This simplifies the management of thousands of zones, and provides added redundancy (by way of database replication) and opens the doors for web frontends that ease this even more.</p>
<p>PowerDNS on Rails is built based on our experience of managing thousands of DNS records through various (often crude) techniques, that included building zone files from databases via cron, and implementing PowerDNS for its database backends.</p>
<p>We first built BIND DLZ on Rails that allowed us to migrate back to BIND using a MySQL 5.0 backend, but after several failed production runs we decided to split the project off to use our existing PowerDNS infrastructure. Using Rails 2 for a interface just makes sense because we can build a rich interface and an REST API in a single go. We have a lot of integration needs, and this was our main driver.</p>
<h2 id="demo-with-vagrant">Demo with Vagrant</h2>
<p>There is now a vagrant/virtualbox demo environment included.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>You will need to have already installed.</p>
<h3 id="running-locally">Running locally</h3>
<p>Once you have Vagrant installed, you can follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/kennethkalmer/powerdns-on-rails.git
$ cd powerdns-on-rails
$ vagrant up</code></pre>
<p>Once this command completes, you can access the powerdns-on-rails by pointing your browser to http://localhost:8080 and logging in with ‘admin@example.com’ &amp; secret.</p>
<p>The first time you run this it will download a base virtual machine and bootstrap a working powerdns-on-rails system. This might take some time, use some storage space (~2GB) and bandwidth (~500MB).</p>
<p>Please note that this is just a demo, we don’t install or configure PowerDNS itself in the VM.</p>
<h2 id="powerdns-information">PowerDNS Information</h2>
<p>The PowerDNS project can be found at http://www.powerdns.com/. The documentation is in-depth on that site, I won’t repeat anything here unless its related to this project specifically.</p>
<p>It is however worth noting that this interface excepts the “Generic MySQL and PgSQL backend” to be used, as per http://doc.powerdns.com/generic-mypgsql-backends.html</p>
