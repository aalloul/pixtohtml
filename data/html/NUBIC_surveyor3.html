<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic/issues/851">an issue with spork and custom inputs in formatstic (#851)</a>. A workaround (thanks rmm5t!):</p>
<pre><code>Spork.prefork do
  # ...
  surveyor_path = Gem.loaded_specs[&#39;surveyor&#39;].full_gem_path
  Dir[&quot;#{surveyor_path}/app/inputs/*_input.rb&quot;].each { |f| require File.basename(f) }
  # ...
end</code></pre>
<h2 id="follow-master">Follow master</h2>
<p>If you are following pre-release versions of surveyor using a <code>:git</code> source in your Gemfile, be particularly careful about reviewing migrations after updating surveyor and re-running the generator. We will never change a migration between two released versions of surveyor. However, we may on rare occasions change a migration which has been merged into master. When this happens, you’ll need to assess the differences and decide on an appropriate course of action for your app. If you aren’t sure what this means, we do not recommend that you deploy an app that’s locked to surveyor master into production.</p>
