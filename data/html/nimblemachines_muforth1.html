<h1 id="what-is-muforth">What is muforth?</h1>
<p>muforth is a small, simple, fast, indirect-threaded code (ITC) Forth intended for use as a cross-compiler for microcontrollers and other embedded devices. It is written in C and its core is very portable. Because of its Forth nature, it is naturally extensible, scriptable, and customizable.</p>
<p>It is very well-suited to interactive coding, debugging, and exploration, and is a great tool for bringing up new hardware.</p>
<p>It has support - in varying degrees of completeness - for the following architectures:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="why-yet-another-forth">Why yet another Forth?</h1>
<p>I initially wrote muforth because I wanted to try out some implementation ideas. Today there is very little that distinguishes muforth from fig-FORTH - but the differences go rather deep.</p>
<p>Its implementation is no longer the point. Its sole reason for existing is to be a cross/meta/target-compiler for <em>other</em> Forths, and their implementations are in no way tied to muforth’s.</p>
<h1 id="starting-points">Starting points</h1>
<p>will tell you how to build muforth. It’s stupid simple.</p>
<p>Sadly, there isn’t a lot of documentation right now. A good place to start is to read the source. It’s generally well-commented, and is intended to be read and understood. mu/startup.mu4 - which is read and executed every time muforth starts - is the heart of the system.</p>
<p>Look in</p>
<p>to find a target that interests you. There is generally a mu/target/<target>/build.mu4 that loads the cross-build environment. Use it as an “index” to find the assembler, disassembler, meta-compiler, kernel, and</p>
