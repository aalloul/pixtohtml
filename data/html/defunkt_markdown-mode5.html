<pre><code>command for inserting or editing image markup.  As with the link
insertion command, through a series interactive prompts you can
insert either an inline or reference image:

*   If both a URL and alt text are given, insert an inline
    image: `![alt text](url)`.
*   If both a `[reference]` label and alt text are given,
    insert a reference link: `![alt text][reference]`.

If there is an existing link or image at the point, these
command will edit the existing markup rather than inserting new
markup.  Otherwise, if there is an active region, these commands
use the region as either the default URL (if it seems to be a
URL) or link text value otherwise.  In that case, the region
will be deleted and replaced by the link.

Note that these functions can be used to convert links and
images from one type to another (inline, reference, or plain
URL) by selectively adding or removing properties via the
interactive prompts.

If a reference label is given that is not yet defined, you
will be prompted for the URL and optional title and the
reference will be inserted according to the value of
`markdown-reference-location`.  If a title is given, it will be
added to the end of the reference definition and will be used
to populate the title attribute when converted to HTML.

Local images associated with image links may be displayed
inline in the buffer by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;C-c C-x C-i&lt;/kbd&gt;
(`markdown-toggle-inline-images`).  This is a toggle command, so
pressing this once again will remove inline images.  Large
images may be scaled down to fit in the buffer using
`markdown-max-image-size`, a cons cell of the form
`(max-width . max-height)`.  Resizing requires Emacs to be
built with ImageMagick support.</code></pre>

<li><p>Text Styles: <kbd>C-c C-s</kbd></p>
<p><kbd>C-c C-s i</kbd> inserts markup to make a region or word italic. If there is an active region, make the region italic. If the point is at a non-italic word, make the word italic. If the point is at an italic word or phrase, remove the italic markup. Otherwise, simply insert italic delimiters and place the point in between them. Similarly, use <kbd>C-c C-s b</kbd> for bold, <kbd>C-c C-s c</kbd> for inline code, and <kbd>C-c C-s k</kbd> for inserting <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p><kbd>C-c C-s q</kbd> inserts a blockquote using the active region, if any, or starts a new blockquote. <kbd>C-c C-s Q</kbd> is a variation which always operates on the region, regardless of whether it</p></li>
