<h1 id="configgy">CONFIGGY</h1>
<p>Configgy is a library for handling config files and logging for a scala daemon. The idea is that it should be simple and straightforward, allowing you to plug it in and get started quickly.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>You would think config files would be a solved problem by now, but for some reason they’re not. Java is still trying to shoehorn “property files” for the purpose (keys and values are strings, no blocks). Python is still trying to use INI files (!), and Ruby invented a new text marshalling format (YAML) and decided to abuse that for config files too. It’s all kind of a sad mess.</p>
<p>Configuration doesn’t have to be a hard problem. My experience shows that only a few features are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>key/value pairs can be set</li>
<li>values can be bools, ints, strings, or lists of strings</li>
<li>sets of key/value pairs can be grouped into blocks and nested inside each other</li>
<li>some blocks can inherit default values from other blocks</li>
<li>values can be based (in some way) on previous values</li>
<li>files can be “imported” into each other</li>
</ul>
<p>From the API side, it should be easy to find and manage key/value pairs and blocks. A library should also be able to “subscribe” to a block and be notified when values have been changed from somewhere else.</p>
<p>None of property files, INI files, or YAML files can do this. So here we are.</p>
<p>At Danger, after several false starts, we ended up with a server config file format very much like what I’ve implemented here (but it was more complex and had a few major flaws). Other projects have created similar formats. So I think this is an idea whose time has come.</p>
<p>Logging is tightly integrated with configuration, since config files are usually used to setup logging, and some sort of logging is usually required at the same time as a config file. So this library puts them together, using the simple config format to setup logging, too – allowing most of the flexibility of java logging, but making it easy to do the common case of creating a single logfile with one debug level.</p>
