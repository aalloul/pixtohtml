<pre><code>-v                - Display version information and quit.

checkin &lt;file&gt;    - Checks for the existence of a DreamWeaver lock file, then
                    checks the file in if you are the owner of the lock.
                    Otherwise, a prompt is shown displaying who really owns the
                    lock, and if you wish to override their lock.

checkin_dir &lt;dir&gt; - Recursively checks for any DreamWeaver lock files within the
                    specified directory, and checks them in if necessary.
                    Provides prompts for lock files checked out by other users.

checkout &lt;file&gt;   - Checks out the file as yourself, if the file is not already
                    checked out.

edit &lt;file&gt;       - Checks out the file, then executes the editor defined in
                    lfwrap.conf.  If the editor is already running, then the
                    set of options used for the second editor is used as defined
                    in lfwrap.conf.

get &lt;file&gt;        - Retrieves the most recent modified date of all files
                    associated with a file, then overwrites the current file
                    with the newest file associated with it.

put &lt;file&gt;        - Copies a file&#39;s contents to all other associated files as
                    defined by sites.conf.

stat &lt;file&gt;       - Prints information about a file, such as if the file is
                    checked out, who has the file checked out, and any other
                    files linked to that file through sites.conf.</code></pre>
