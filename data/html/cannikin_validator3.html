<p>This validation checks that the phone number matches a certain format, namely xxx-xxx-xxxx where ‘x’ must be a digit. This function was broken into multiple lines for clarity, and uses the regular if/else syntax rather than the shorter ?: syntax, all of which is perfectly valid and may make it easier to read (just make sure you get your } and )’s correct!).</p>
<p>Now that you know how to validate a field, what happens when it gets validated?</p>
<h1 id="how-fields-are-marked-validinvalid">How Fields are Marked Valid/Invalid</h1>
<p>When a field is validated and found to be valid or invalid, two things occur:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A class is added to the valid/invalid field</li>
<li>A
<div>
containing an error message is inserted into the HTML on the page</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="errorvalid-classes">Error/Valid Classes</h2>
<p>By default, if a field is found to be invalid, a class of “error” is added to the invalid field. Likewise, if a field is found to be valid, a class of “valid” is added to the field. So, if we’re validing that ‘first_name’ isn’t blank, and it is, after the validation the field will look like:</p>
<p><input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" class="error" /></p>
<p>If this was validated by means of the auto class=“required”-type validation, the field would look like:</p>
<p><input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" class="required error" /></p>
<p>The “error” class is simply appended to the list of classes already on the field. If a field is valid, the same rules apply as above, only the class added is “valid” instead of “error.”</p>
<p>What good does this do you? Well, you can set a CSS rule that all <input> fields with an “error” class have a 2 pixel red border, for example. Or you can ignore the class altogether if you don’t want to highlight the field.</p>
<p>“Am I forced to only use ‘error’ and ‘valid’ as my class names?” No. See “Customizing the Validator” section below for info.</p>
