<h1 id="dateperformance">Date::Performance</h1>
<p>This package adds some semblance of performance to Ruby 1.8’s core Date class using a combination of different techniques:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Implements various core <em>Date</em> methods in C. This is nowhere near a complete rewrite of all <em>Date</em> features but many of the hot spots have been replaced with machine code.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide alternate implementations of <code>strftime</code> and <code>strptime</code> in C. The stock date formatting and parsing methods are extremely slow compared to their libc counterparts. <em>Date#sys_strftime</em> and <em>Date::sys_strptime</em> are light facades on top of the system’s <code>strftime(2)</code> and <code>strptime(2)</code>. The system methods run 10x and 50x (yes, <em>fifty-ecks</em>) faster than their Ruby based counterparts, respectively. Unfortunately, <code>strftime(2)</code> and <code>strptime(2)</code> implementations vary from system to system and have various limitations not found in the core Date implementation so can not safely be used as replacements for the core methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Memoization. The <em>Date::Memoize</em> module can be used to speed certain types of repetitive date processing significantly. This file must be required separately.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
<p>This package is mostly transparent after an initial require:</p>
<pre><code>require &#39;date/performance&#39;
Date.new 1912, 6, 23
# Wow! That was fast!</code></pre>
<p><em>Date::Performance</em> is not used directly but automatically replaces core <em>Date</em> methods when required.</p>
<p>In addition to the C extension, the <em>Date::Memoization</em> module can be used to speed things up even further in some cases by making a trade off between space and time:</p>
<pre><code>require &#39;date/memoize&#39;
Date.new 1912, 6, 23
Date.parse &#39;1912-06-23&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Requiring the file automatically replaces <em>Date::new</em> / <em>Date::civil</em>, <em>Date::parse</em>, and <em>Date::jd</em> methods with memoized versions.</p>
