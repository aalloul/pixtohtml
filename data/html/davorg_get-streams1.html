<h1 id="deprecated">DEPRECATED</h1>
<p>This was fun while it lasted and it generated a lot of attention (not least, from the BBC itself!)</p>
<p>But all things must pass. And with the arrival of the Radio iPlayer the BBC have retired all of the audio streams which this program relied on.</p>
<p>Therefore this program no longer does anything useful and is only left here for historical interest.</p>
<h1 id="get_streams">get_streams</h1>
<p><code>get_streams</code> is a program that parses the BBC radio web site looking for Real Audio streams of program content. The streams found are then written to a YAML (see http://www.yaml.org/) file for later processing.</p>
<p>The distribution also includes a sample index.tt file which can be used to generate a web page from the YAML data.</p>
<p>The intention is for people to be able to sidestep the BBC’s complex navigation and open the streams directly in RealPlayer.</p>
<p>The URLs of the stream may also be of use to people using something like Ben Hammersley’s RadioPod application (see http://www.benhammersley.com/weblog/2004/11/14/releasing_radiopod.html).</p>
<p>If you don’t want to go to all the hassle of installing and running the program yourself, then the output will be online at</p>
<p>http://dave.org.uk/streams/</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p><code>get_streams</code> is a Perl program, so you’ll need Perl installed. A recent version (at least 5.6.x) is recommended.</p>
<p>You’ll also need the following extra Perl modules from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/).</p>
<ul>
<li>LWP::Simple</li>
<li>HTML::TreeBuilder</li>
<li>URI</li>
<li>YAML</li>
</ul>
<p>The index.tt file is a Template Toolkit. To use it you’ll need to install the Template Toolkit from either CPAN or http://tt2.org/. You will also need the Template::Plugin::YAML module.</p>
