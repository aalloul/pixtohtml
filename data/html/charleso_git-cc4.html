<p>any activity information. This is largely for convenience for me so I don’t have to rewrite everything. Therefore things like ‘recommended’ baselines are ignored. I don’t know if this will cause any major dramas or not.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re most likely running gitcc under Windows Cmd. At moment this isn’t supported. Instead use Git Bash, which is a better console anyway. :-)</p>
<p>If you have both msysgit and Cygwin installed then it may also be problem.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>cleartool: Error: Not an object in a vob: “.”.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ClearCase directory you’ve specified in init isn’t correct. Please note that the directory must be inside a VOB, which might be one of the folders inside the view you’ve specified.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>fatal: ambiguous argument ‘ClearCase’: unknown revision or path not in the working tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this is your first rebase then please ignore this. This is expected.</p>

<li>pathspec ‘master_cc’ did not match any file(s) known to git</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<p>A smart person would have looked at other git bridge implementations for inspiration, such as git-svn and the like. I, on the other hand, decided to go cowboy and re-invent the wheel. I have no idea how those other scripts do their business and so I hope this isn’t a completely stupid way of going about it.</p>
<p>I wanted to have it so that any point in history you could rebase on-top of the current working directory. I’ve done this by using the ClearCase commit time for git as well. In addition the last rebased commit is tagged and is used to limit the history query for any chances since. This tagged changeset is therefore also used to select which commits need to be checked into ClearCase.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>It is worth nothing that when initially importing the history from ClearCase that files not currently in your view (ie deleted) cannot be reached without a config spec change. This is quite sad and means that the imported history is not a true one and so rolling back to older revisions will be somewhat limited as it is likely everything won’t compile. Other ClearCase importers seem restricted by the same problem, but none-the-less it is most frustrating. Grr!</p>
