<h1 id="mooish-template">Mooish Template</h1>
<p>A template for building JS libraries structured like [Mootools][1], works great for building code on top of Mootools (plugins/classes/extensions etc). I use this to store and maintain all of my reusable JS that I use in my various projects. It is essentially a directory of code with each component in its own file, a file defining dependencies, a builder ruby script and two test frameworks. Included is some sample code w/ tests. It maintains pointers in various places to other JS library directories (with their own <code>scripts.json</code> file) so that it can include all the dependencies at build time. Read the “Initial Setup” section for help on this.</p>
<p>The most important part of this organization scheme is that all of your js code lives in one place, is tested in one place and is pushed/pulled from one place. You don’t have to bother updating a mootools file in all of your projects when a new version comes out. You just update your <em>one</em> mootools or repo and use the builder to make new lib js files for your projects. Better still, all of the tests in this template pull the code from your mootools repo dynamically before each test is run - there really isn’t a stagnant copy of mootools or other js library lying around anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h2>
<p>This template works best if you have a mootools-core directory/repo on your disk somewhere. I keep mine at the same level as this directory as its own git repo so I can have all the remotes setup the way I want. This means I can switch the branch of my mootools-core repo to a different version etc. and build <code>lib.js</code> files with that version of moo. Very convenient. If you want your mootools-core and other libraries in a different place just search for the string “../mootools-core” in this project and correct it (and the other library paths) to your specifications. You will probably want to look at: <code>build.yml</code>, <code>config.js</code>, <code>index.html</code> and <code>suite.html</code>.</p>
<p>After that follow the directions below to add you code to Source/, Tests/ and Specs/</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-the-box">What’s in the box?</h2>
<p>You may have noticed there are some files in this directory. Let me explain:</p>
<h3 id="builder.rb">builder.rb</h3>
<p>There is a customized bulder.rb script (based on the one included in moo-core) that allows for multiple pointers to <code>scripts.json</code> files. With this you can build a customized js file that includes classes from any library (with a <code>scripts.json</code> file), including your own source code. For example:</p>
