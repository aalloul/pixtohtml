<h3 id="demo">Demo/</h3>
<p>A basic example of a demo html/js combo. The html file uses the Mootools builder to import the code to be demoed (along with all of mootools) and has some sample elements to test on. The js file just sets up a simple test case of the component being demoed.</p>
<h2 id="adding-your-code">Adding your code</h2>
<p>Got some sweet code to add to your project? Follow these simple steps to glory:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add the class/class.extension in its own file in the Source directory. If it doesn’t fit into one of the directories there, create a new one.</li>
<li>Add your new filename to <code>scripts.json</code>. The first level of the hash there is for the directories under Source. The 2nd level is for the files in those directories. Make sure to add a desc(ription) and dep(endencie)s. The dependencies can be anything found in a <code>scripts.json</code> file you pointed to in build.yml.</li>
<li><p>If this particular code doesn’t do anything visual, add your tests to <code>Specs/sample_specs.js</code> in its own describe block. You will also have to add the directory/filename to the custom Builder call at the top of Specs/suite.html (around line 20) so that the test suite will know to pull in your code before it runs. You may also have to edit src and Builder.root locations to point at your own Mootools-core repo.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you’ll need to add a test to the Unit Test Framework. Follow the same steps for adding a director/file from 1. but do it in Tests/UserTests and add two files: <code>ClassName.testname.js</code> and <code>ClassName.testname.html</code>. Now add your ClassName &amp; testname to <code>UserTests/test.json</code> so they’ll show up in the list. Oh also maybe write test code and html in those two files (look at the others for an example).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="running-your-tests">Running your tests</h2>
<p>This template comes with two test suites: Screwunit for specs and Mootools Unit Test Framework for the more interactive tests. The specs cover all of the components that can be tested non-visually. The unit tests cover everything that needs a human to judge the result.</p>
<p>For the interactive tests you should have Apache/Nginx or some other webserver serving the files. Just point your browser at the Tests directory. For the specs you don’t need the webserver - just point your browser at Specs/suite.html. You may also need to edit <code>/Tests/config.js</code> to point to the right library source directories. The first object being passed in to the UnitTester constructor is what you should change.</p>
