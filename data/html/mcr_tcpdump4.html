<pre><code>number of acks.

Following the summary line is one line of information
per chunk.  The line contains eight fields:
   1 - the chunk number
   2 - the start sequence number for this chunk
   3 - time of first send
   4 - time of last send
   5 - time of first ack
   6 - time of last ack
   7 - number of times chunk was sent
   8 - number of times chunk was acked
(all times are in decimal seconds, relative to the start
of the conversation.)

As an example, here is the first part of the output for
an ftp trace:

# 134 chunks.  536 packets sent.  508 acks.
1       1       0.00    5.80    0.20    0.20    4       1
2       513     0.28    6.20    0.40    0.40    4       1
3       1025    1.16    6.32    1.20    1.20    4       1
4       1561    1.86    15.00   2.00    2.00    6       1
5       2049    2.16    15.44   2.20    2.20    5       1
6       2585    2.64    16.44   2.80    2.80    5       1
7       3073    3.00    16.66   3.20    3.20    4       1
8       3609    3.20    17.24   3.40    5.82    4       11
9       4097    6.02    6.58    6.20    6.80    2       5

This says that 134 chunks were transferred (about 70K
since the average packet size was 512 bytes).  It took
536 packets to transfer the data (i.e., on the average
each chunk was transmitted four times).  Looking at,
say, chunk 4, we see it represents the 512 bytes of
sequence space from 1561 to 2048.  It was first sent
1.86 seconds into the conversation.  It was last
sent 15 seconds into the conversation and was sent
a total of 6 times (i.e., it was retransmitted every
2 seconds on the average).  It was acked once, 140ms
after it first arrived.</code></pre>
<p>stime.awk atime.awk Output one line per send or ack, respectively, in the form <time> &lt;seq. number&gt; where <time> is the time in seconds since the start of the transfer and &lt;seq. number&gt; is the sequence number being sent or acked. I typically plot this data looking for suspicious patterns.</p>
