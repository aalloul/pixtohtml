<p>== Paml == A Pythonic transpiler for HTML/XML – Author: S�bastien Pierre <a href="mailto:sebastien@ivy.fr">sebastien@ivy.fr</a> – Date: 03-Oct-2009 – Creation: 24-Aug-2007</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>People who care about web application design and development know that it’s better to write your HTML by hand rather than using a tool to produce it. The reasons are that you know and control the information and the structure of your documents, which is a critical aspect when your HTML is the basis for a JavaScript-driven rich client application.</p>
<p>Writing HTML is quite painful, and you have some tools out there to help you in this task. You can use templating languages like Cheetah or KID (Python) or RHTML (Ruby) to make your life easier and encourage re-use of bits of code – but you may find that process a bit too complicated for your daily usage.</p>
<p>Some people tried to make writing HTML easier, the [HAML][HAML] or [SLIP][SLIP] projects are good examples of that. However, HAML is too tied to Ruby and RHTML, and SLIP was not flexible enough and a bit outdated.</p>
<p>Pamela is an attempt at following the path of HAML and SLIP, while improving on some aspects:</p>
<p>Be simple:: while there is a need for include/import of elements, there is no need for supporting a full templating system. This helps keep the syntax sane and easy.</p>
<p>Less errors:: it is easy to make mistakes when you write HTML (forget to close tags, empty divs that are removed by the browser), so Pamela’s syntax is designed to prevent errors and maximize re-use and readability.</p>
<p>Does one thing, but does it very well:: we do not want to introduce features tied to a specific technology not related to HTML. Pamela will only output HTML/XML, and does not try to be a full templating language. Pamela does its best to offer you the most flexibility in producing the HTML document that you want.</p>
<p>For designers and developers:: whether you quickly want to prototype your design or define CSS classes and ids to hook your JavaScript on, Pamela will make it easy and quick to do what you want and help people understand your design.</p>
<p>Pamela’s syntax was designed to be very easy to learn, to be consistent, to favor explicit over implicit, and to allow people to quickly write HTML code.</p>
