<p>Yes, h2o has them. However, if you are careful, these shouldn’t hinder your template development. The deep inheritance issue is a bit problematic for some template architectures, but again, if you are careful, and perhaps a bit inventive, it won’t hinder you terribly much.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{{ block.super }}</code> doesn’t work with more than 1 level of inheritance yet, so if <code>{{ block.super }}</code> invokes another <code>{{ block.super }}</code> it won’t work just yet.<br />
</li>
<li>‘if’ conditions don’t support multiple expressions or mathematical expressions yet, like: <code>{% if something &gt; 3 or something &lt; 2 %}</code> or <code>{% if something + else &gt; 12 %}</code> These likely will not be implemented in the future unless some daring soul implements them and contributes the code back to the h2o-php project.</li>
</ul>
