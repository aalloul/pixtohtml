<p>This is the Java version of LIBLINEAR.</p>
<p>The project site of the original <code>C++</code> version is located at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/</p>
<p>The upstream changelog can be found at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/log</p>
<p>The upstream GitHub project can be found at https://github.com/cjlin1/liblinear</p>
<p>Please be aware that the code would be written differently at various places, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java coding style,</li>
<li>less static functions and state,</li>
<li>smaller classes and methods,</li>
</ul>
<p>if it would be a pure Java project.</p>
<p>However, I tried to stick as close as possible to the original C++ source code for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Patches for the original C++ version can often be applied easily</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Probability of translation errors</strong>: Sticking to the original source code makes it less likely to introduce new bugs that are caused by porting to Java.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code Reviews</strong>: It should be more easy to conduct code reviews since the sources can be compared to the original version.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Below follows a slightly modified version of the original README file. Please note that the README refers to the C++ version. As afore mentioned, the Java version is almost identical to use.</p>
<p>The three most important methods for programmatic usage that you might be interested in are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Linear.train(…)</code></li>
<li><code>Linear.predict(…)</code></li>
<li><code>Linear.predictProbability(…)</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>LIBLINEAR is a simple package for solving large-scale regularized linear</p>
