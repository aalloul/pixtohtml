<h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a simple HTML prototype of Radiant written in HAML that is designed to be viewed with serve.</p>
<p>What is Serve? Serve is an open-source rapid prototyping framework for Web applications. It makes it easy to prototype functionality without writing a single line of backend code.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-contribute">Can I contribute?</h2>
<p>Sure! We welcome contributions to the prototype. If you have an idea for a new feature this is the perfect place to get the action rolling. Once you have it prototyped using serve, create a ticket on the dev site and attach your patch. Then give us a holler on the dev mailing list and we can debate the merits of your idea there.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-install-and-run-serve">How do I install and run Serve?</h2>
<p>Serve is distributed as a Ruby gem to make it easy to get up and running. You must have Ruby installed in order to download and use Serve. The Ruby download page provides instructions for getting Ruby setup on different platforms:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" class="uri">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a></p>
<p>After you have Ruby installed, open up the command prompt and type:</p>
<pre><code>gem install serve</code></pre>
<p>(OSX and Unix users may need to prefix the command with <code>sudo</code>.)</p>
<p>After Serve is installed, you can start it up in a given directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>serve</code></pre>
<p>This will start Serve on port 4000. You can now view the prototype in your Web browser at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://localhost:4000" class="uri">http://localhost:4000</a></p>
