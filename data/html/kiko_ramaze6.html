<h3 id="direct-download">Direct Download</h3>
<p>You can alternatively download the latest source code in a tarball from .</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Now that you have a vague idea of what youâ€™re about to get into you might just want to get a way to get up and running ASAP. Please read below for more information about installation.</p>
<p>Depending on what you are planning to do you can either just go and start reading the source or directly get some hands-on experience by trying some of the examples. Most things will require dependencies though. The basic functionality is provided by the WEBrick adapter and the Template::Ramaze, which just run out of the box. For more features you will have to install some templating-engines and mongrel (<em>very</em> recommended). Ramaze will inform you when it needs further dependencies, so just go and try some things.</p>
<p>Some places to get started are: - Read the documentation. - Run and read the test cases. - Look at the examples and run/modify them.</p>
<h2 id="a-couple-of-examples">A couple of Examples</h2>
<p>There are some examples for your instant pleasure inside the examples-directory in the Ramaze-distribution. You can start up an example just as you usually would any other ruby program:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby examples/basic/hello.rb</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd examples/app/blog
$ ruby start.rb</code></pre>
<p>For more information about the usage of ramaze try:</p>
<pre><code>$ ramaze --help</code></pre>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>examples/basic/hello.rb Hello, World!</p></li>
<li><p>examples/basic/simple.rb A bit more advanced than the hello-example, but still very basic.</p></li>
</ul>
