<h2 id="common-lisp-reminders">Common Lisp Reminders</h2>
<p>This module does basically what remind by David Skoll does. However, as a library, it allows for more options and expansions than remind (in my humble opinion).</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to write this library in Common Lisp to try doing something vaguely useful in CL and so that other CL apps can pull it in if there is not something like this already (NOTE: Found one set of date utilities somewhat similar to this library on CLIKI or some other CL site).</p>
<p>Remind (the command line utility) is a useful tool, but only allows creation of text reminders (for calendars or for echoing to the command line) or commands that can be run on a given date (via the RUN keyword). To do more than this with a reminder requires entering a reminder twice. CL-Remind will not need to have reminders entered twice.</p>
<p>The aim of this utility is to allow a user to simply create a number of reminders and then do with them as they wish.</p>
<h2 id="the-things-you-might-want-to-do-with-a-reminder-are-not-an-exhaustive-list">The things you might want to do with a reminder are (not an exhaustive list)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an ICS file from a reminder to send to someone or to use in software that uses ICS files (NOTE: Need to make a read/write ICS module).</li>
<li>Create a marked calendar from a group of reminder entries.</li>
<li>Apply an algorithm to existing entries to work out some sort of ‘how hard am I working ?’ index.</li>
<li>Send email warning of reminders due to occur.</li>
<li>…And generally allow a richer scripting environment for managing reminder based data.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h1>
<p>A simple reminder for Saint Pats day is</p>
<pre><code>(rem-text &quot;Saint Patrick&#39;s day&quot; :day 17 :month 3)</code></pre>
<p>If there are no date params this means the reminder is triggered every day</p>
<pre><code>(rem-text &quot;Learn something new today&quot;) </code></pre>
<p>Reminders can have repeats</p>
<pre><code>(rem-text &quot;Green rubbish bin goes out&quot; :d 24 :m May :repeat-days 14)</code></pre>
<p>Reminders can have repeats with an allowed number of repeat counts.</p>
<pre><code>(rem-text &quot;Remind 3 times&quot; :d 8 :m Jan :repeat-days 5 :repeat-count 3)</code></pre>
<p>They can also have warnings. A warning will get triggered for the days before the 25th and on the 25th itself.</p>
