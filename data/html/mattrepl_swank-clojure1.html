<h1 id="swank-clojure">Swank Clojure</h1>
<p>is an adapter that lets you use SLIME (the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) with Clojure. It’s designed to work with GNU Emacs 22 and higher. It may work with forks like XEmacs or Aquamacs, but those are unsupported.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Depending on what you’re using it for, Swank Clojure can be invoked in a few different ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Standalone Session: If you just hit M-x slime, swank-clojure will download the jars for Clojure 1.0, contrib, and swank-clojure, launch an instance, and connect to it. If you just want to try out Clojure, this is all you need. Just get Swank Clojure through</p></li>
<li><p>Custom classpath: If you want to hack on Clojure or Contrib, set swank-clojure-classpath to a list of paths to the jars you want to use and then hit M-x slime.</p></li>
<li><p>Project: Put your project’s dependencies in the lib/ directory, (either manually or using then launch M-x swank-clojure-project. Note that you must have swank-clojure.jar in the lib/ directory, it will not automatically add itself to the classpath as it did in past versions that had to run from a checkout.</p></li>
<li><p>Standalone Server: Users of leiningen or clojure-maven-plugin can <a href="http://wiki.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/emacs-integration">launch a server from a shell</a> and connect to it from within Emacs using M-x slime-connect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the JVM classpath can’t be modified at runtime, you can’t start a session with plain M-x slime and then decide to work on your project; you’ll need to start a new slime session with M-x swank-clojure-project.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Install using package.el[1].</p>
<p>If you’re only going to use #4 above, you’ll only need the “slime-repl” package. Otherwise get the “swank-clojure” package.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to install swank-clojure manually, it’s not recommended. ELPA will be included in the next version of Emacs and</p>
