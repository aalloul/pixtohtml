<pre><code>2.2 is fully supported and recommended. There are currently no plans to
drop official support for it.</code></pre>
</dd>
<dt>
Rubinius
</dt>
<dd>
Rubinius is officially supported (Rubinius &gt;= 2.x). It is recommended to <tt>gem install puma</tt>.
</dd>
<dt>
JRuby
</dt>
<dd>
The latest stable release of JRuby is officially supported. It is not recommended to use C extensions with JRuby. It is recommended to <tt>gem install trinidad</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Versions of Ruby prior to 2.2.2 are no longer supported as of Sinatra 2.0.</p>
<p>We also keep an eye on upcoming Ruby versions.</p>
<p>The following Ruby implementations are not officially supported but still are known to run Sinatra:</p>
<ul>
<li>Older versions of JRuby and Rubinius</li>
<li>Ruby Enterprise Edition</li>
<li>MacRuby, Maglev, IronRuby</li>
<li>Ruby 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 (but we do recommend against using those)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not being officially supported means if things only break there and not on a supported platform, we assume it’s not our issue but theirs.</p>
<p>We also run our CI against ruby-head (future releases of MRI), but we can’t guarantee anything, since it is constantly moving. Expect upcoming 2.x releases to be fully supported.</p>
<p>Sinatra should work on any operating system supported by the chosen Ruby implementation.</p>
<p>If you run MacRuby, you should <code>gem install control_tower</code>.</p>
<p>Sinatra currently doesn’t run on Cardinal, SmallRuby, BlueRuby or any Ruby version prior to 2.2.</p>
<h2 id="the-bleeding-edge">The Bleeding Edge</h2>
<p>If you would like to use Sinatra’s latest bleeding-edge code, feel free to run your application against the master branch, it should be rather stable.</p>
