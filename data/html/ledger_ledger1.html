<h1 id="ledger-command-line-accounting">Ledger: Command-Line Accounting</h1>
<p>Ledger is a powerful, double-entry accounting system that is accessed from the UNIX command-line. This may put off some users, since there is no flashy UI, but for those who want unparalleled reporting access to their data there are few alternatives.</p>
<p>Ledger uses text files for input. It reads the files and generates reports; there is no other database or stored state. To use Ledger, you create a file of your account names and transactions, run from the command line with some options to specify input and requested reports, and get output. The output is generally plain text, though you could generate a graph or html instead. Ledger is simple in concept, surprisingly rich in ability, and easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="for-the-impatient">For the Impatient</h2>
<p>I know, you just want to build and play. If you have all the dependencies installed (see below), then simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/ledger/ledger.git
$ cd ledger &amp;&amp; ./acprep update  # Update to the latest, configure, make</code></pre>
<p>Now try your first ledger command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./ledger -f test/input/sample.dat reg</code></pre>
<p>For help on keeping your journal have a look at the [documentation] and the [wiki][] (Also see the “Resources” section at the end of this file). An emacs mode for ledger files can be found in the <code>lisp</code> directory and a vim plugin is located in the [ledger/vim-ledger repository].</p>
<h2 id="to-the-rest">To the Rest</h2>
<p>If you’re reading this file, you have in your hands the Bleeding Edge. This may very well <em>not</em> be what you want, since it’s not guaranteed to be in a functionally complete state. It’s under active development, and may change in any way at any time. What you may prefer is the <strong>CURRENT</strong> stable release, or the <strong>BETA</strong> branch.</p>
