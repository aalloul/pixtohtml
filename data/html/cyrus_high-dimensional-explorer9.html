<p>Each time a GCM is needed, HiDEx will seek and reuse a GCM saved in the work directory. This feature is enabled by using the saveGCM setting in the config file. Please see the config file documentation for more info.</p>
<p>Warning: On some computers it may be faster to NOT save the GCM and recalculate the GCM each time. Please try both modes to compare.</p>
<p>Getting neighborhoods:</p>
<p>NOTE: The output of the following commands will depend on the settings you have made in the configuration file. Please see section 2H for an explanation of all the settings possible.</p>
<p>To get neighborhoods in a word space, use the “getneighbors” mode, as in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>  hidex -m getneighbors</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: There are two numbers reported for each word of interest: 1) ANS: Average Neighbour Similarity (The average similarity between the word and its neighbors that are defined by the threshold. 2) InvNCOUNT: The inverse of the number of neighbors (+1).</p>
<p>To find the similarity between pairs of words, use the “getsimilarity”:</p>
<pre><code>  hidex -m getsimilarity</code></pre>
<p>To output specific vectors from the GCM in a dense matrix format text file, use the “getvectors” mode:</p>
<pre><code>       hidex -m getvectors</code></pre>
<p>To run a large batch of models and find neighborhoods, use the “batchneighbors” mode: [Currently under development. Please do not use!]</p>
<pre><code>  hidex -m batchneighbors</code></pre>
<p>To run a large batch of models and find inter-word distances, use the “batchsimilarity” mode: [Currently under development. Please do not use!]</p>
<pre><code>  hidex -m batchsimilarity</code></pre>
<p>For all of these commands, the output will be saved in a new folder called “output.date.time”. This folder will be created in the current directory, or if you have specified a different output directory in the configfile, in that directory.</p>
<p>To add more text to your co-occurrence database, you can change the corpus</p>
