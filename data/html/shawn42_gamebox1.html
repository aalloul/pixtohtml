<h2 id="getting-started-with-gamebox">Getting started with Gamebox</h2>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p><strong>Why use Gamebox?</strong> Gamebox was designed to spring board game development. It allows the developer to define business rules about a game very quickly without having to worry about resource loading, sound/music management, creating windows, or messing with viewports. Gamebox allows you to define a game’s business rules within minutes, using the metaphor of a 5th grade play.</p>
<p>The driving idea behind Gamebox is to provide the ability to have as many of the basic common pieces of a <strong>2D game</strong> at the developers disposal from the beginning.</p>
<p>The reason I wrote Gamebox is twofold: first, to aid in 48 hour game writing competitions and second, to allow me to write simple educational games for my kids.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>gem install gamebox</code></li>
<li><code>git clone git://github.com/shawn42/gamebox.git &amp;&amp; cd gamebox &amp;&amp; bundle &amp;&amp; rake install</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="game-creation">Game Creation</h3>
<p>To create a new Gamebox project run:</p>
<pre><code>$ gamebox new zapper</code></pre>
<p>This will create the directory structure and needed files to get a basic actor up on the screen:</p>
<p>``` zapper ├── Gemfile ├── README.rdoc ├── Rakefile ├── config │ ├── boot.rb │ ├── environment.rb │ └── game.yml ├── data</p>
