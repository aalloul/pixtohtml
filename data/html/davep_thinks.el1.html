<p><code>thinks.el</code> is a little bit of silliness inspired by the think bubbles you see in cartoons. It allows you to</p>
<pre><code>. o O ( insert text that looks like this )</code></pre>
<p>into a buffer. This could possibly be handy for use in email and usenet postings.</p>
<p>Note that the code can handle multiple lines</p>
<pre><code>. o O ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
      ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
      ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )</code></pre>
<p>You can also control how the bubble looks with <code>thinks-from</code>. The above had it set to <code>top</code>. You can have <code>middle</code>:</p>
<pre><code>      ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
. o O ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
      ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )</code></pre>
<p><code>bottom</code>:</p>
<pre><code>      ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
      ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
. o O ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )</code></pre>
<p>and <code>bottom-diagonal</code>:</p>
<pre><code>      ( like this. That is, a body of text where the number of characters )
      ( exceeds the bounds of what you might consider to be a acceptable  )
      ( line length (he says, waffling on to fill a couple of lines).     )
    O

.</code></pre>
<p>By default all of the thinking functions will fill (word wrap) the text</p>
