<li>If everything works as expected you should see the Selenium test runner. The north east frame contains all your test cases (just one for now), and the north frame contains your test case.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="formats">Formats</h2>
<p>The test cases can be written in a number of formats. Which one you choose is a matter of taste. You can generate your test files by running script/generate selenium or by creating them manually in your /test/selenium directory.</p>
<h2 id="rselenese-.rsel">RSelenese, .rsel</h2>
<p>RSelenese lets you write your tests in Ruby. This is my favorite format.</p>
<pre><code>setup :fixtures =&gt; :all
open &#39;/&#39;
assert_title &#39;Home&#39;
(&#39;a&#39;..&#39;z&#39;).each {|c| open :controller =&gt; &#39;user&#39;, :action =&gt; &#39;create&#39;, :name =&gt; c }</code></pre>
<p>See SeleniumOnRails::TestBuilder for available commands. <em>IMPORTANT NOTE:</em> RSelenese generates the HTML tables for Selenium behind the scenes when the page is loaded - ONCE. That means code like this:</p>
<pre><code>(1..10).each do |index|
    do something
end</code></pre>
<p>Will only be executed when the test is loaded, not when the test is run. This is a common error and leads to tests that work the first time and fail the second time.</p>
<h2 id="selenese-.sel">Selenese, .sel</h2>
<p>Selenese is the dumbest format (in a good way). You just write your commands delimited by | characters.</p>
<pre><code>|open|/selenium/setup|
|open|/|
|goBack|</code></pre>
<p>If you don‘t want to write Selenese tests by hand you can use SeleniumIDE which has support for Selenese.</p>
<h2 id="htmlrhtml">HTML/RHTML</h2>
<p>You can write your tests in HTML/RHTML but that‘s mostly useful if you have existing tests you want to reuse.</p>
<h2 id="partial-test-cases">Partial test cases</h2>
<p>If you have some common actions you want to do in several test cases you can put them in a separate partial test case and include them in your other test cases. This is highly recommended, just as small functions would be recommended in structured programming.</p>
<p>A partial test case is just like a normal test case besides that its filename has to start with _:</p>
<pre><code>#_login.rsel
open &#39;/login&#39;
type &#39;name&#39;, name
type &#39;password&#39;, password
click &#39;submit&#39;, :wait=&gt;true</code></pre>
<p>To include a partial test case in a RSelenese test case:</p>
