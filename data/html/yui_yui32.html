<pre><code>into the next YUI release. The code changes in `master` are either bug fixes
or small changes which should not break API compatibility. Patch releases
will be cut from this branch; e.g. 3.6.x. *All code in this branch has fully
passed all unit tests and should be stable.*</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>3.x</code>: (Read-only) Represents the next major YUI release; e.g.Â 3.7.0. This is an integration branch which contains everything in <code>master</code>, plus larger code changes which will go into a future YUI release. The changes in <code>3.x</code> require a minor version increment before they are part of release, e.g., 3.7.0. Preview Releases will be cut from this branch for developers to test and evaluate. <em>All code in this branch has fully passed all unit tests and should be stable.</em></p></li>
<li><p><code>dev-master</code> and <code>dev-3.x</code>: Current working branches containing code that <strong>has not</strong> been through the CI process. <strong>Developers check their changes in to these integration branches for the automated testing system to validate.</strong> Once they are validated, the code is merged into <code>master</code> and <code>3.x</code> respectively. <strong>Never</strong> check in to <code>master</code> or <code>3.x</code> directly.</p></li>
<li><p><code>release-3.x.x</code>: Short-lived release branches where code checkins are carefully managed for extensive testing and release deployment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="source-tree">Source Tree</h2>
<p>The YUI source tree includes the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>build</code>: Built YUI source files. The built files are generated at development time from the contents of the <code>src</code> directory. The build step generates debug files (unminified and with full comments and logging), raw files (unminified, but without debug logging), and minified files (suitable for production deployment and use).</p></li>
<li><p><code>src</code> Raw unbuilt source code (JavaScript, CSS, image assets, ActionScript files, etc.) for the library. Beginning with YUI 3.4.0, the <code>src</code> directory also contains all module-specific documentation, tests and examples. All modifications to the library and its documentation should take place in this directory.</p></li>
