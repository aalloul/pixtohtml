<p>database, this means it is easy to write scripts which modify configuration without fear of breaking a big configuration file.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-other-basic-features-of-netcon">What are the other basic features of Netcon?</h2>
<ul>
<li>data is stored in a MySQL database</li>
<li>monitoring is performed by a lightweight data-collection client</li>
<li>configuration data about what to monitor is administered centrally</li>
<li>custom data-collection clients can be written by extending the Netcon data-collection agent in Python, or by merely speaking the Netcon http protocol</li>
<li>clients can (optionally) save and report data for disconnected periods</li>
<li>hierarchial redundant trigger suppression</li>
<li>services are specified in role-groups and applied to a set of machines</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-does-netcon-work">How does Netcon work?</h2>
<p>One way to understand Netcon is to consider the flow of monitored data through the system. Here is a description of the cycle of data collection through an incident notification and resolution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>netcon server startup</li>
<li>netcon client startup
<ol type="a">
<li>checkin with server to get configuration</li>
<li>begin monitoring, periodically reporting data to server</li>
</ol></li>
<li>netcon server accepts reported data from many clients
<ol type="a">
<li>for each piece of data, update the ‘current’ state of that service</li>
<li>roll previous data into ‘history’</li>
</ol></li>
<li>netcon server periodically checks for errors
<ol type="a">
<li>load all triggers and check against ‘current’ state</li>
<li>record any trigger state changes</li>
<li>for any triggered errors, add them to the active incident, creating one if necessary</li>
</ol></li>
<li>netcon server periodically handles notifications
<ol type="a">
<li>iterate through active incidents, make sure currently active users are watching these incidents</li>
<li>iterate over watched incidents for each user, and generate notifications (user can choose a single email, or a single email per incident)</li>
<li>deactivate incidents which have been resolved and which have passed their ‘watch’ period without any activity.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>When the user receives a notification, that notification will indicate the severity of the incident, and the number of failures present on that incident. By visiting the web-interface, the user can check the detailed information reported on the incident, as well as add notes to the incident.</p>
