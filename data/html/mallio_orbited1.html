<h1 id="orbited-on-rails">Orbited on Rails</h1>
<p>Orbited on Rails is a plugin that makes it easy for your Rails application to use Comet to push changes to your users.</p>
<p>[Comet][1], also known as Reverse Ajax and server push (among other nicknames), is a method of pushing data to your users without polling. <a href="htttp://orbited.org">Orbited</a> is one implementation of this method that uses a Python push server that can interact with a number of messaging protocols such as STOMP, IRC, and XMPP.</p>
<p>Traditionally, when web devolopers have a need to broadcast any data to people currently using the site, such as people using a chat interface, they would use polling. Each client browser would, after a certain interval, send a request to the server to see if there had been any changes, and update accordingly. However, there are a few problems with this method. If you set the interval too high, then some people might be waiting a while to see the changes. If the interval is too low, then the server is constantly being hammered and could run out of resources.</p>
<p>Orbited to the rescue! Orbited allows browsers to hold a long connection to the server with little overhead so that changes can be pushed to all connected clients simultaneously. This Rails plugin allows you to add Orbited support in just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>Note: Currently, this plugin only supports the STOMP protocol, but I hope to add support for the other protocols in the future.</p>
