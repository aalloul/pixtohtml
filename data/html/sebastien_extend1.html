<p>Extend implements a flexible class-based OOP layer on top of the JavaScript prototype object model.</p>
<p>Extend allows you to write nice and clean classes in JavaScript, features introspection and class meta-information, is mature and .</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The problem</h1>
<p>JavaScript being a prototype-based object language, it does not offer (in standard) a ‘’class-based’’ OOP layer. This can become a problem when you’re writing medium to large system, where prototypes start to be cumbersome to manage.</p>
<p>The famous JavaScript provides a very basic way to create classes, but does not provide any inheritance between classes. Extensions such as [ExtendClass][2] and [ExtendClassFurther][3] tried to add sub-classing, but fail to have a flexible and reliable <code>super</code>-equivalent, which makes advanced JavaScript application development difficult.</p>
<p>Moreover, neither of these extensions allow meta-information specification to classes (such as class name, methods, parent class, etc), while this information is very useful for debugging and introspection.</p>
<p>Additionally, common cases such as handing an object method to a callback that may alter the ‘this’ is not supported ( callback do that).</p>
<h1 id="introducing-extend">Introducing Extend</h1>
<p>Extend is a simplified, cleaner version of the Extend 1.X library, with the same design goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional class-based OOP layer for JavaScript</li>
<li>Notion of class attributes (shared), methods and class methods (operations)</li>
<li>Introspection API to list attributes, methods, operations</li>
<li>Makes the difference between what is inherited and what is not inherited</li>
<li>Easy wrapping of object methods to be safely given as callbacks</li>
</ul>
