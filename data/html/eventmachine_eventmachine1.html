<h2 id="what-is-eventmachine">What is EventMachine</h2>
<p>EventMachine is an event-driven I/O and lightweight concurrency library for Ruby. It provides event-driven I/O using the , much like , Pythonâ€™s , libevent and libev.</p>
<p>EventMachine is designed to simultaneously meet two key needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely high scalability, performance and stability for the most demanding production environments.</li>
<li>An API that eliminates the complexities of high-performance threaded network programming, allowing engineers to concentrate on their application logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This unique combination makes EventMachine a premier choice for designers of critical networked applications, including Web servers and proxies, email and IM production systems, authentication/authorization processors, and many more.</p>
<p>EventMachine has been around since the early 2000s and is a mature and battle-tested library.</p>
