<p>This is Expat, a C library for parsing XML, started by in 1997. Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser. This means that you register handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These handlers are called when the parser discovers the associated structures in the document being parsed. A start tag is an example of the kind of structures for which you may register handlers.</p>
<p>Windows users should use the , which includes both precompiled libraries and executables, and source code for developers.</p>
<p>Expat is . You may copy, distribute, and modify it under the terms of the License contained in the file</p>
<p>distributed with this package. This license is the same as the MIT/X Consortium license.</p>
<p>If you are building Expat from a check-out from the , you need to run a script that generates the configure script using the GNU autoconf and libtool tools. To do this, you need to have autoconf 2.58 or newer. Run the script like this:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>./buildconf.sh</code></pre>
<p>Once this has been done, follow the same instructions as for building from a source distribution.</p>
<p>To build Expat from a source distribution, you first run the configuration shell script in the top level distribution directory:</p>
<pre class="console"><code>./configure</code></pre>
<p>There are many options which you may provide to configure (which you can discover by running configure with the <code>--help</code> option). But the one of most interest is the one that sets the installation directory. By default, the configure script will set things up to install</p>
