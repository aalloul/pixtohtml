<h2 id="configuring-autumn-for-your-first-launch">Configuring Autumn for Your First Launch</h2>
<p>Before you can run Autumn and try out the example leaves, you’ll need to set up a few things. Here are the steps:</p>
<h3 id="configure-your-testing-season">Configure Your Testing Season</h3>
<p>In Autumn, your leaves run in an environment, called a “season.” Each season has different leaves and different settings for those leaves. By default, Autumn comes with a season called “testing” already set up for you. You can edit that season or create a new one with <code>script/generate season [season name]</code>. The files for your season are stored in the <code>config/seasons</code> directory.</p>
<p>First, edit the <code>stems.yml</code> file. This file stores information about your IRC connection. Edit it to connect to an IRC server of your choosing. For more information, see <strong>Stems</strong> below.</p>
<p>Next, edit the <code>database.yml</code> file. As mentioned previously, Scorekeeper requires the DataMapper gem because it uses a persistent store. By default it’s set up to use a SQLite database, but you can use PostgreSQL or MySQL if you’d like. If you’d prefer not to install any of these database solutions, delete the <code>database.yml</code> file and remove the Scorekeeper leaf from the <code>leaves.yml</code> and <code>stems.yml</code> files.</p>
<p>If you do choose to set up a database, you will have to run <code>DB=Scorekeeper rake db:migrate</code> after your <code>database.yml</code> file is configured and your database is created.</p>
<p>Lastly, view the <code>leaves.yml</code> file. You shouldn’t have to make any changes to this file, but it’s a good idea to look at it to see how leaves are configured. You can do the same with the <code>season.yml</code> file. See “Seasons” and “Leaves” below for more.</p>
<h3 id="starting-the-server">Starting the Server</h3>
<p>Run the command <code>script/server</code> to start the server. After a short while, your leaf should appear in the channel you specified. You can type “!points Coolguy +5” and then “!points” to get started using Scorekeeper, or “!insult Steve” to play with Insulter. Have some fun, and when you’re satisfied, stop the server by typing “!quit”.</p>
<p>If you’d like to daemonize your server, you can use the shell commands <code>rake app:start</code> and <code>rake app:stop</code>. For more information, see <strong>Tasks</strong> below.</p>
