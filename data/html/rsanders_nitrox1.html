<h1 id="nitrox---an-iphone-htmljs-application-environment">Nitrox - an iPhone HTML/JS Application Environment</h1>
<p>For all the divers in the house…what’s better than AIR? NITROX!</p>
<p>A Cocoa/Objective-C wrapper for Javascript applications on the iPhone which provides access to native iPhone functions.</p>
<p>See http://code.google.com/p/nitrox for more information.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-use-nitrox">How to Use Nitrox</h1>
<p>Nitrox is not a browser. It is intended to be used as a library and wrapper for iPhone applications written with HTML and Javascript.</p>
<p>The underlying mechanism is the iPhone UIKit’s UIWebView. As of iPhone SDK 2.1, most of the device-specific functionality of the iPhone is not exposed to Javascript programs. The goal of Nitrox is to make that functionality available.</p>
<p>To create a Nitrox application, you should create a new Cocoa Touch application in Xcode just as you would for a pure Objective-C application. Then you will follow the steps described in INSTALL.md to make Nitrox available to your main application.</p>
<p>In addition, you will include a “web” directory with the application which contains your HTML and Javascript files.</p>
<p>You can extend Nitrox with your own Objective-C functions. You do not need to use Nitrox for your entire application. You can use it for only certain views or functions, and use pure Objective-C for others.</p>
<h2 id="similar-systems">Similar systems</h2>
<p>Phonegap (http://www.phonegap.com/) is the most similar. The main difference between Phonegap and Nitrox is that Nitrox uses a local XMLHTTPRequest/Ajax connection to invoke Objective-C from Javascript.</p>
<p>See http://code.google.com/p/nitrox/wiki/Performance for a comparison and performance analysis.</p>
