<ul>
<li>RFC5322 Support, Reading and Writing</li>
<li>RFC6532 Support, reading UTF-8 headers</li>
<li>RFC2045-2049 Support for multipart emails</li>
<li>Support for creating multipart alternate emails</li>
<li>Support for reading multipart/report emails &amp; getting details from such</li>
<li>Wrappers for File, Net/POP3, Net/SMTP</li>
<li>Auto-encoding of non-US-ASCII bodies and header fields</li>
</ul>
<p>Mail is RFC5322 and RFC6532 compliant now, that is, it can parse US-ASCII and UTF-8 emails and generate US-ASCII emails. There are a few obsoleted syntax emails that it will have problems with, but it also is quite robust, meaning, if it finds something it doesn’t understand it will not crash, instead, it will skip the problem and keep parsing. In the case of a header it doesn’t understand, it will initialise the header as an optional unstructured field and continue parsing.</p>
<p>This means Mail won’t (ever) crunch your data (I think).</p>
<p>You can also create MIME emails. There are helper methods for making a multipart/alternate email for text/plain and text/html (the most common pair) and you can manually create any other type of MIME email.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>Next TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve MIME support for character sets in headers, currently works, mostly, needs refinement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-policy">Testing Policy</h2>
<p>Basically… we do BDD on Mail. No method gets written in Mail without a corresponding or covering spec. We expect as a minimum 100% coverage measured by RCov. While this is not perfect by any measure, it is pretty good. Additionally, all functional tests from TMail are to be passing before the gem gets released.</p>
