<h2 id="doc-comments">Doc Comments</h2>
<p>A full description of the format of doc comments can be found on the Sun Javadoc web site (http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/). Doc comments look like this:</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * This is the typical format of a simple documentation comment
 * that spans two lines.
 */</code></pre>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>PHPDoctor supports the following tags within a doc comment:</p>
<pre><code>@author name-text
@deprecated deprecated-text
{@link package.class#member label}
{@linkplain package.class#member label}
@param parameter-type parameter-name description
@return return-type description
@see packahge.class#member
@since since-text
@var var-type
@version version-text</code></pre>
<p>Some Javadoc tags are not relevant to PHP, others are added or slightly changed due to PHPs loose typing.</p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Q: Why do we need another PHPDdoc clone?</p>
<p>A: I wrote PHPDoctor because I back in 2004, I couldnâ€™t find a Javadoc clone for PHP that was small and simple and worked out of the box or that worked at all. The PHP tokenizer extension has made creating PHPDoc programs really easy since PHP can now do the hard work for you.</p>
<p>Q: Why is PHPDoctor different from other PHPDoc programs?</p>
<p>A: PHPDoctor is very small and easy to use, sticking as closely as possible to the way Javadoc works, including using the same program structure and doclet approach to templating. PHPDoctor has a very small learning curve, most people should be able to generate API</p>
