<p>You can also add specific words to the mail config, which if present in any of the input fields, will throw an error. This way if you get hit by a barage of say, ‘imabot@spammer.net’, you just add that term to the block list. Here is how you would edit the “mailer” part to implement this:</p>
<pre><code>subject: From the website of Whatever
from: noreply@mydomain.com
redirect_to: /contact/thank-you
max_filesize: 100000
recipients:
  - one@one.com
  - two@two.com
block_words:
  - spammer
  - badword
  - imabot</code></pre>
<h3 id="file-attachments">File attachments</h3>
<p>In many cases it is desirable to limit the maximum size of a file that may be uploaded. This is set as the max_filesize attribute for mailers in the mailer page part. Any file included in the form will have the limit imposed. Following is a simple example mailer part that includes a file size limit of 100,000 bytes:</p>
<pre><code>subject: From the website of Whatever
from: noreply@mydomain.com
redirect_to: /contact/thank-you
max_filesize: 100000
recipients:
  - one@one.com
  - two@two.com</code></pre>
<p>The following is a simple form that might be used to submit a file for the above configuration:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;r:mailer:form name=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;
    Type your message: &lt;r:mailer:text name=&quot;themessage&quot; /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
    Select a file: &lt;r:mailer:file name=&quot;thefile&quot; /&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;r:mailer:submit value=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/r:mailer:form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If a user does not select a file the other form contents will still be e-mailed. The <code>&lt;r:mailer:get name=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;</code> (with <code>&lt;r:mailer:file name=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;</code>) will provide the uploaded file name.</p>
<p>If you are using email or email_html parts then the <code>&lt;r:mailer:get name=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</code> tag can be used to retrieve the name of the uploaded file. If no file was uploaded “” will be returned.</p>
<h3 id="submit-placeholder">Submit placeholder</h3>
<p>If you wish to show that activity is taking place during submission you may use the <code>&lt;r:mailer:submit_placeholder /&gt;</code> tag in your form. This will insert a hidden div with the contents of the submit_placeholder page part. The div will be displayed when the user clicks any submit button.</p>
<h3 id="user-provided-configuration">User-provided Configuration</h3>
<p>Sometimes, rather than explicitly configuring the recipients and such in the mailer part, you’d rather have them passed in by the person submitting the form. Mailer supports this by allowing you to specify a form field to pull the value from:</p>
<pre><code>from_field: my_form_field_that_contains_the_from_email_address</code></pre>
<p>Then you just have to add that field to your mailer form and you’re all set.</p>
