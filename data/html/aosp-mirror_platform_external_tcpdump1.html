<p>This directory contains source code for tcpdump, a tool for network monitoring and data acquisition. This software was originally developed by the Network Research Group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The original distribution is available via anonymous ftp to <code>ftp.ee.lbl.gov</code>, in <code>tcpdump.tar.Z</code>. More recent development is performed at tcpdump.org, http://www.tcpdump.org/</p>
<p>Tcpdump uses libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture. Before building tcpdump, you must first retrieve and build libpcap, also originally from LBL and now being maintained by tcpdump.org; see http://www.tcpdump.org/ .</p>
<p>Once libpcap is built (either install it or make sure it’s in <code>../libpcap</code>), you can build tcpdump using the procedure in the <code>INSTALL.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>The program is loosely based on SMI’s “etherfind” although none of the etherfind code remains. It was originally written by Van Jacobson as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve tcp and internet gateway performance. The parts of the program originally taken from Sun’s etherfind were later re-written by Steven McCanne of LBL. To insure that there would be no vestige of proprietary code in tcpdump, Steve wrote these pieces from the specification given by the manual entry, with no access to the source of tcpdump or etherfind.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, tcpdump has been steadily improved by the excellent contributions from the Internet community (just browse</p>
