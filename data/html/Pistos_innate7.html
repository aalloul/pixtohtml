<p>Having “provides” means that every Action has different ways of being rendered, depending on so-called wishes, that’s what people usually call content-representation.</p>
<p>A wish may be anything related to the request object, and by default it will trigger on the filename extension asked for. This enables you to create a single action that can be rendered in json/rss/atom/yaml/xml/xhtml/html/wap or different languages…</p>
<p>The dispatching in Node depends on the filename extension by default, but more decision paths can be added to Action by overriding some defaults.</p>
<p>Layouts map to wishes just like views, so every content representation can have a suitable layout as well.</p>
<p>This is very alien to old Ramaze, which always has a 1:1 mapping between actions and their views and how they are rendered, which made people wonder how to serve sass as css or how to respond with json for a ajax request until they finally were pointed to setting content-type, using respond and setting up custom routes.</p>
<p>I hope this feature makes things simpler for people who care about it while it can be ignored by people who don’t.</p>
<h3 id="more-specifics">More specifics</h3>
<p>Here I try to list the most important things that Ramaze will offer but that are not included in Innate itself in terms of globs:</p>
<ul>
<li>cache.rb and cache/*.rb</li>
<li>current/response.rb</li>
<li>tool/{create,mime,localize,daemonize,record,project_creator}.rb</li>
<li>spec/helper/*.rb</li>
<li>snippets/**/*.rb</li>
<li>gestalt.rb</li>
<li>store/default.rb</li>
<li>contrib.rb or any contribs</li>
<li>adapter/*.rb (superseded by a lightweight adapter.rb)</li>
<li>template/ezamar<em>/</em></li>
<li>bacon.rb</li>
<li>dispatcher.rb</li>
<li>dispatcher/*.rb</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be a couple of things I’ve forgotten, but that’s what a quick glance tells me.</p>
<p>Let’s go through them one by one and consider what’s gonna happen to them:</p>
