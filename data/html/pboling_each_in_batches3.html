<pre><code>Required:

  :arel          - Usage: :arel =&gt; Payment.canceled.order(&quot;transaction_id ASC&quot;)
                    Required, as this is the class that will be batched

Optional:

  :verbose       - Usage: :verbose =&gt; true or false
                    Sets verbosity of output
                    Default: false (if not provided)

  :backwards     - Usage: :backwards =&gt; true or false
                    Using the order supplied for :arel (if any) figures out what the batch set looks like,
        and begins working from the end rather than the front.
                    Default: false (if not provided)
        Example: EachInBatches::Batch.new(:arel =&gt; Report.where(company_id: nil).order(&quot;id ASC&quot;), :backwards =&gt; true, :batch_size =&gt; 50).run{|x| x.destroy }

  :batch_size    - Usage: :batch_size =&gt; x
                    Where x is some number.
                    How many AR Objects should be processed at once?
                    Default: 50 (if not provided)

  :last_batch    - Usage: :last_batch =&gt; x
                    Where x is some number.
                    Only process up to and including batch #x.
                      Batch numbers start at 0 for the first batch.
                    Default: won&#39;t be used (no limit if not provided)

  :first_batch   - Usage: first_batch =&gt; x
                    Where x is some number.
                    Begin processing batches beginning at batch #x.
                      Batch numbers start at 0 for the first batch.
                    Default: won&#39;t be used (no offset if not provided)

  :show_results  - Usage: :show_results =&gt; true or false
                    Prints statistics about the results of Batch#run.
                    Default: true if verbose is set to true and :show_results is not provided, otherwise false</code></pre>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p>Interpreting the output:</p>
<pre><code>&#39;[O]&#39; means the batch was skipped due to an offset.
&#39;[L]&#39; means the batch was skipped due to a limit.
&#39;[P]&#39; means the batch is processing.
&#39;[C]&#39; means the batch is complete.
and yes... it was a coincidence.  This class is not affiliated with &#39;one laptop per child&#39;</code></pre>
