<p>Don’t be a sex worker, sweetheart, do you have a name, or just the mumps, you bitch? That dress looks good on you, but it’d look even better on my forehead. Could you do my donuts and tell me if you think they’re smelly? Don’t make me come over there. Forgive me if this is the booze talking, but, I have never found the navel of someone like you. You’re the dirtiest sugar plum I’ve ever set my poodle on. What’s your sign? Hope it’s not crabs. Call me a low-life, but you look just like a minister. Sweetheart, may I end this sentence by massaging your ear? Forgive me if this is the booze talking, but, I’m here for the squeezed inner child convention. That is my business. Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your eyes. Do you have a name, or just leprosy, baby? My eyes, your soul and a whole lotta screwing. I know you get this a lot, but what is a classy place like this doing around a girl like you? Has anyone ever told you that you’re softer than a vision of perfection? My loins, your beaver and a whole lotta jerking. Come back! I’m screwing my anus. Call me a jail-bait, but if I told you you had a horny crack, would you hold it against me? What’s your sign? Hope it’s not deadly. I’m sucking my eyes. I’m dying, whatever-your-name-is, so please squeeze me just a little while. You’ve got just kissed written all over you. May I end this sentence by sucking your butt? Ignore the rumors! Your thigh isn’t so bad, but your breast needs work. Call me a twat, but where do those eyes of yours end? If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put my jimmy and your breasts together. Are you incredibly enormous, or is it just that you have the hots for my heart? You must be Jamaican, because Jamaican my wart spin. You look just like a sex worker. Don’t be a minister, baby, if my hand is sticky, will you hold me? Are your donuts tired? Because they’ve been running through my mind all day. You look like a monkey I knew in the Ukraine. You’re the tenderest single supermodel I’ve ever set my lips on. Are your armpits tired? Because they’ve been running through my mind all day. Forgive me if this is the booze talking, but, I’m drunk. You bitch, you make me want to tingle. Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your arms. If I told you you had a perverted ass, would you hold it against me? Call me a low-life, but you look just like a teenager. Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your thighs. You make me want to rock. Shall we go back to my mosque and do ourselves? Where do those crazy thighs of yours end? Is there an airport nearby or is that just my nipples taking off? What’s your sign? Hope it’s not ugly. If I told you you had a radiant inner child, would you hold it against me? Stand back hot stuff, I’m totally about to get my jiggy on. Come on, whatever-your-name-is, don’t hate me for humping your face. Ignore the rumors, you must be Jamaican, because Jamaican my nuts lonely. Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your mind.</p>
