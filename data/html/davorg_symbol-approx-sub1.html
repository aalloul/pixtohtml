<p>#Symbol::Approx::Sub#</p>
<p>##What is Symbol::Approx::Sub?##</p>
<p>Symbol::Approx::Sub is a Perl module which allows you to call subroutines using approximate names.</p>
<p>Of course, why you might want to do that is a completely different question. You almost certainly don’t want to do it in production code as it will make your program almost completely unmaintainable.</p>
<p>I only wrote this module to test my understanding of typeglobs and AUTOLOAD. I really don’t expect it to have any sensible uses at all (but if you find one, I’d be interested in knowing what it is).</p>
<p>##How Do I Install It?</p>
<p>Symbol::Approx::Sub uses the standard Perl module architecture and can therefore by installed using the standard Perl method which, in brief, goes something like this:</p>
<pre class="unix"><code>   gzip -cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install</code></pre>
<p>Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are installing.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work for you then creating a directory called Symbol/Approx somewhere in your Perl library path (<span class="citation" data-cites="INC">@INC</span>) and copying the Sub.pm file into this directory should also do the trick.</p>
<p>##Prerequisites##</p>
<p>As of version 1.03, Symbol::Approx::Sub uses Devel::Symdump to do all of the clever glob-walking stuff, so you’ll need to get that from CPAN and install it before installing Symbol::Approx::Sub.</p>
<p>##Where is the Documentation?##</p>
<p>All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Approx.pm</p>
