<h1 id="imageflow">Imageflow</h1>
<p>An application proving an graphical node-based user interface for creating [ImageJ][imagej] workflows, for Macro creation and image editing in general.</p>
<h2 id="imageflow-provides">ImageFlow Provides</h2>
<p>It provides you with the means to create macros by connecting nodes to form a workflow, which represents the way macro-commands are called by ImageJ. These workflows can be saved and loaded.</p>
<p>A workflow consists of Sources, which load or create images. They will be connected to other units to define the order of processing. A workflow requires at least one node to be defined as a display. The result of this unit will be opened after running the workflow.</p>
<p>ImageFlow is also available as a stand-alone program that uses ImageJ as a library. To run it, download and extract the archive Imageflow.zip and double click on the ImageFlow_.jar. Works on all platforms, Java 5.0 or later must be installed.</p>
<p>A number of unit-elements for building graphs are included, however the list is not very long yet. Documentation on how to create own units is included and can be used. I can incorporate more units in later releases. Feedback of any kind is well appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>
<h3 id="run-from-compiled-binaries">Run from compiled Binaries</h3>
<p>Delete the previous version, download Imageflow-binaries and extract somewhere on your hard drive. Start the jar to run the program.</p>
<p>To start Imageflow from ImageJ you have to move “ImageFlow”-folder into ImageJ’s plugin directory. After restarting ImageJ you will find a menu-item in the Plugins-Menu to start the plugin.</p>
<h3 id="compile-from-sources">Compile from Sources</h3>
<p>Checkout the source code from [github][github]. The current stable version is on the Master-Branch, the latest Version is on the Development-Branch. Compile the sources to executable jars by running the build-script.</p>
<pre><code>$ ant build</code></pre>
<p>The resulting build will be in “dist/release/”, there are two differen jar variants:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>in <code>executable</code> is the Standalone executable Jar</li>
<li>in <code>plugin</code> is the All-In-One ImageJ Plugin Jar</li>
</ol>
<p>Both can be used as ImageJ plugins, the latter is more compact.</p>
<h3 id="contribution">Contribution</h3>
<p>I welcome any feedback: ideas, use cases, bugs as well as code contribution. Just fork and play around.</p>
