<p>This list is by no means a full listing of all these people, but I try to get a good coverage despite that.</p>
<p>I would like to thank:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yukihiro Matsumoto a.k.a matz</p>
<p>For giving the world Ruby and bringing fun back into programming.</p></li>
<li><p>Zed Shaw a.k.a. zedas</p>
<p>For developing Mongrel, Ramaze started out as a simple Hello World based on that awesome server.</p></li>
<li><p>Christian Neukirchen a.k.a chris2</p>
<p>For building rack, which is just what the numerous web-developers had anticipated and which will, with no doubt, change the world.</p></li>
<li><p>Pistos</p>
<p>For continious encouragment and building the first real webpage on Ramaze. His bugreports were invaluable.</p></li>
<li><p>Jim Weirich</p>
<p>For Rake, which lifts off a lot of tasks from the shoulders of every developer who uses it.</p></li>
<li><p>Thomas Sawyer a.k.a Trans</p>
<p>Dragging me deep into the rabbit-hole and showing me how awesome Ruby truely is through his work on facets, ratchets and tons of other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>George Moschovitis a.k.a gmosx</p>
<p>For his tremendous efforts in the Nitro/Og framework, which is a source of steady inspiration for Ramaze and brought me to Ruby in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Rob Levin a.k.a. lilo</p>
<p>He founded the most excellent Freenode IRC-network, where the most important channels for rubyists are located (as is #ramaze). May he rest in peace.</p></li>
<li><p>The guys (and gals) in the various channels on Freenode</p>
<p>As the people are way too many to be listed, here the channels that i call my online home.</p></li>
</ul>
