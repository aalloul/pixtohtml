<h1 id="new-relic-ruby-agent">New Relic Ruby Agent</h1>
<p>New Relic is a performance management system, developed by New Relic, Inc (http://www.newrelic.com). It provides you with deep information about the performance of your Rails or Ruby application as it runs in production and transmits them to newrelic.com where you can monitor them in real time. The New Relic Ruby Agent is dual-purposed as a either a Gem or a Rails plugin, hosted on .</p>
<h2 id="supported-environments">Supported Environments</h2>
<p>An up-to-date list of Ruby versions and frameworks for the latest agent can be found on .</p>
<p>You can also monitor non-web applications. Refer to the “Other Environments” section under “Getting Started”.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-code">Contributing Code</h2>
<p>We welcome code contributions (in the form of pull requests) from our user community. Before submitting a pull request please review .</p>
<p>Following these helps us efficiently review and incorporate your contribution and avoid breaking your code with future changes to the agent.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Add the Ruby Agent to your project’s Gemfile.</p>
<pre><code>gem &#39;newrelic_rpm&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To monitor your applications in production, create an account at http://newrelic.com/ . There you can sign up for a free Lite account or one of our paid subscriptions.</p>
<p>Once you receive the welcome email with a license key and <code>newrelic.yml</code> file, you can copy the <code>newrelic.yml</code> file into your app config directory OR can generate the file manually with command:</p>
<pre><code>newrelic install --license_key=&quot;YOUR_KEY&quot; &quot;My application&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The initial configuration is done in the <code>newrelic.yml</code> file. This file is by default read from the <code>config</code> directory of the application root and is subsequently searched for in the application root directory, and then in a <code>~/.newrelic</code> directory. Once you’re up and running you can enable Server Side Config and manage your newrelic configuration from the web UI.</p>
