<p><code>ActionController::Base.relative_url_root</code> after the context path. Useful for running a rails app from the same war as an existing app, under a sub-path of the main servlet context root. - <code>gem.path</code>: Relative path to the bundled gem repository. Defaults to <em>/WEB-INF/gems</em>. - <code>jruby.compat.version</code>: Set to “1.8” or “1.9” to make JRuby run a specific version of Ruby (same as the –1.8 / –1.9 command line flags). - <code>jruby.min.runtimes</code>: For non-threadsafe Rails applications using a runtime pool, specify an integer minimum number of runtimes to hold in the pool. - <code>jruby.max.runtimes</code>: For non-threadsafe Rails applications, an integer maximum number of runtimes to keep in the pool. - <code>jruby.runtime.init.threads</code>: How many threads to use for initializing application runtimes when pooling is used (default is 4). It does not make sense to set this value higher than <code>jruby.max.runtimes</code>. - <code>jruby.runtime.init.serial</code>: When using runtime pooling, this flag indicates that the pool should be created serially in the foreground rather than spawning (background) threads, it’s by default off (set to false). For environments where creating threads is not permitted. - <code>jruby.runtime.acquire.timeout</code>: The timeout in seconds (default 10) to use when acquiring a runtime from the pool (while a pool maximum is set), an exception will be thrown if a runtime can not be acquired within this time ( accepts decimal values for fine tuning e.g. 1.25). - <code>jruby.runtime.env</code>: Allows to set a custom ENV hash for your Ruby environment and thus insulate the application from the environment it is running. By setting this option to en empty string (or ‘false’) it acts as if the ENV hash was cleared out (similar to the now deprecated <code>jruby.rack.ignore.env</code> option). - <code>jruby.runtime.env.rubyopt</code>: This option is used for compatibility with the (deprecated) <code>jruby.rack.ignore.env</code> option since it cleared out the ENV after RUBYOPT has been processed, by setting it to true ENV[‘RUBYOPT’] will be kept. - <code>jruby.rack.logging</code>: Specify the logging device to use. Defaults to <code>servlet_context</code>. See below. - <code>jruby.rack.request.size.initial.bytes</code>: Initial size for request body memory buffer, see also <code>jruby.rack.request.size.maximum.bytes</code> below. - <code>jruby.rack.request.size.maximum.bytes</code>: The maximum size for the request in memory buffer, if the body is larger than this it gets spooled to a tempfile. - <code>jruby.rack.response.dechunk</code>: Set to false to turn off response dechunking (Rails since 3.1 chunks response on <code>render stream: true</code>), it’s on by default as frameworks such as Rails might use <code>Rack::Chunked::Body</code> as a Rack response body but since most servlet containers perform dechunking automatically things might end double-chunked in such cases. - <code>jruby.rack.handler.env</code>: <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> Allows to change Rack’s behavior on obtaining the Rack environment. The default behavior is that parameter parsing is left to be done by the Rack::Request itself (by consuming the request body in case of a POST), but if the servlet request’s input stream has been previously read this leads to a limitation (Rack won’t see the POST paras). Thus an alternate pure ‘servlet’ env “conversion” is provided that maps servlet parameters (and cookies) directly to Rack params, avoiding Rack’s input parsing. - <code>jruby.rack.filter.adds.html</code>: <strong>deprecated</strong> use <code>addsHtmlToPathInfo</code> filter config init parameter. The default behavior for Rails and many other Ruby applications is to add an</p>
