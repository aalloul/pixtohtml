<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Addressbook consists of 4 main sections:</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>Search allows you to search for contacts by full or partial last name.</p>
<h3 id="contacts">Contacts</h3>
<p>Contacts is used to manage your, you guessed it, contacts. The contacts sections allows you to view and edit all information for a given contact.</p>
<h3 id="addresses">Addresses</h3>
<p>Addresses is used to manage the addresses of your contacts. Each address has an address type (Individual, Family, Married Couple, Unmarried Couple, etc). The address type is used to determine the “addressee” of the address. For example, if Joe Smith and Jane Smith share an address, the addressee would be the following for the specific address types:</p>
<p>“Individual” - “Mr. Joe Smith”<br />
“Family” - “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Joe &amp; Jane Smith &amp; Family”<br />
“Married Couple” - “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Joe &amp; Jane Smith”<br />
“Unmarried Couple” - “Mr. Joe Smith &amp; Ms. Jane Smith”<br />
“Single Parent” - “Mr. Joe Smith &amp; Family”</p>
<p>The home phone is also stored along with the address, since home phones are specific to a home.</p>
<p>You can specify the two main contacts for an address by selecting the primary and secondary contact on the address details page. These contacts are used</p>
