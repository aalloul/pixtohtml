<h2 id="supported-browsers">Supported Browsers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Firefox 2+</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 6+</li>
<li>Opera 9+</li>
<li>Safari 3+</li>
<li>Mobile Safari</li>
<li>Android</li>
</ul>
<p>Other browsers may work, but haven’t been tested. It’s a safe bet that anything based on a recent version of Gecko or WebKit will probably work.</p>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>All browsers support parallel loading of CSS. However, only Firefox and Opera currently support parallel script loading while preserving execution order. To ensure that scripts are always executed in the correct order, LazyLoad will load all scripts sequentially in browsers other than Firefox and Opera. Hopefully other browsers will improve their parallel script loading behavior soon.</p>
