<p>As you’ve no doubt noticed, I’ve not been maintaining MIDIator for some time. Frankly, I published this gem out of a personal need that no longer exists, and then I lazily chose to neglect my obligation to the community. I apologize for the lack of maintenance.</p>
<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you migrate to Ari Russo’s <a href="https://github.com/arirusso/unimidi">unimidi</a> library as soon as possible. It looks a lot nicer than MIDIator and it’s actively maintained.</p>
<p>Thanks for the interest and support!</p>

<h2 id="description">DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>A nice Ruby interface to your system’s MIDI services.</p>
<p>MIDIator was inspired by Topher Cyll’s fantastic Practical Ruby Projects book. In it, Topher describes how to interact with the MIDI providers in OSX, Linux, and Windows. As I was reading the book, I noticed some things I would do differently, which got me thinking that maybe it would be valuable to package up my modifications to the book’s code and release it as a gem.</p>
<h2 id="features">FEATURES:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform system for MIDI output</li>
<li>Built-in softsynth (OS X only, so far)</li>

<h2 id="credits">CREDITS:</h2>
<p>Huge, huge credit goes to Topher Cyll, without whom I would have had to figure all of this crap out for myself. Apress also deserves some</p>
