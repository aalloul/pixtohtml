<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Mail is an internet library for Ruby that is designed to handle emails generation, parsing and sending in a simple, rubyesque manner.</p>
<p>The purpose of this library is to provide a single point of access to handle all email functions, including sending and receiving emails. All network type actions are done through proxy methods to Net::SMTP, Net::POP3 etc.</p>
<p>Built from my experience with TMail, it is designed to be a pure ruby implementation that makes generating, sending and parsing emails a no brainer.</p>
<p>It is also designed from the ground up to work with the more modern versions of Ruby. This is because Ruby &gt; 1.9 handles text encodings much more wonderfully than Ruby 1.8.x and so these features have been taken full advantage of in this library allowing Mail to handle a lot more messages more cleanly than TMail. Mail does run on Ruby 1.8.x… it’s just not as fun to code.</p>
<p>Finally, Mail has been designed with a very simple object oriented system that really opens up the email messages you are parsing, if you know what you are doing, you can fiddle with every last bit of your email directly.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>Mail has been downloaded millions of times, by people around the world, in fact, it represents more than 1% of <em>all</em> gems downloaded.</p>
<p>It is (like all open source software) a labour of love and something I am doing with my own free time. If you would like to say thanks, please feel free to and feel free to send me a nice email :)</p>
