<p>I plan to document other things I use deprec for on http://www.deprec.org/. Feel free to poke around and see what’s there. I use deprec to provision and manage servers so you might find some things in there I haven’t documented. Lucky you.</p>

<p>Deprec was inspired and uses the brilliantly executed Capistrano. Thanks Jamis! This gem includes a modified copy of Neil Wilson’s very useful vmbuilder_plugins gem.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
