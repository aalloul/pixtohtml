<p>Document everything, classes, modules, methods, configuration…</p>
<p>Through 100% documentation Ramaze gives the developer easy and solid understanding of the underlying concepts and functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Open development</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to contribute to Ramaze in the easiest way possible. The repository is open for patches passing the Test-suite.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples</p>
<p>Everyone learns different, some only read the source, others browse documentation, but everyone loves examples for a quick and painless start.</p>
<p>Ramaze addresses this need and offers a wide variety of examples of usage, basic functionality, project-layout and more advanced applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Fully BDD (Behaviour Driven Design)</p>
<p>Ramaze has a very complete set of so-called specifications built by RSpec. These specs define the way Ramaze has to behave.</p>
<p>The specs are checked every time a new patch is pushed into the repository, deciding whether the changes the patch applies are valid and don’t break the framework.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>via RubyGems</p>
<p>The simplest way of installing Ramaze is via the gem.</p>
<p>is the package manager for ruby apps and libraries and provides you with the last tagged version of Ramaze.</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze</code></pre>
<p>Versions are made as we see fit and get an announcement out (usually that’s the major obstacle as there is a lot to announce).</p>
<p>If you want to install the nightly gem of Ramaze you can do this with:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze --source=http://gem.ramaze.net/</code></pre>
<p>We also use the gem building process on github, which locates gems at http://gems.github.com - so you can get a version from there as well:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install manveru-ramaze --source=http://gems.github.com/</code></pre></li>
</ul>
