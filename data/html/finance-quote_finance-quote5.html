<p>The sources method returns a list of sources that have currently been loaded and can be passed to the fetch method. If you’re providing a user with a list of sources to choose from, then it is recommended that you use this method.</p>
<h2 id="currency_lookup">CURRENCY_LOOKUP</h2>
<pre><code>$currencies_by_name = $q-&gt;currency_lookup( name =&gt; &#39;Australian&#39; );
$currencies_by_code = $q-&gt;currency_lookup( code =&gt; qr/^b/i      );
$currencies_by_both = $q-&gt;currency_lookup( name =&gt; qr/pound/i
                                         , code =&gt; &#39;GB&#39;         );</code></pre>
<p>The currency_lookup method provides a search against the known currencies. The list of currencies is based on the available currencies in the Yahoo Currency Converter (the list is stored within the module as the list should be fairly static).</p>
<p>The lookup can be done by currency name (ie “Australian Dollar”), by code (ie “AUD”) or both. You can pass either a scalar or regular expression as a search value - scalar values are matched by substring while regular expressions are matched as-is (no changes are made to the expression).</p>
<p>See (and the <code>t/currencies.t</code> test file) for a way to make sure that the stored currency list is up to date.</p>
<h2 id="currency">CURRENCY</h2>
<pre><code>$conversion_rate = $q-&gt;currency(&quot;USD&quot;,&quot;AUD&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>The currency method takes two arguments, and returns a conversion rate that can be used to convert from the first currency into the second. In the example above, we’ve requested the factor that would convert US dollars into Australian dollars.</p>
<p>The currency method will return a false value if a given currency conversion cannot be fetched.</p>
<p>At the moment, currency rates are fetched from Yahoo!, and the information returned is governed by Yahoo!’s terms and conditions. See Finance::Quote::Yahoo for more information.</p>
<h2 id="set_currency">SET_CURRENCY</h2>
<pre><code>$q-&gt;set_currency(&quot;FRF&quot;);  # Get results in French Francs.</code></pre>
<p>The set_currency method can be used to request that all information be returned in the specified currency. Note that this increases the chance stock-lookup failure, as remote requests must be made to fetch both the stock information and the currency rates. In order to improve reliability and speed performance, currency conversion rates</p>
