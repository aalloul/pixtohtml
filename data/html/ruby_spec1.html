<h1 id="the-ruby-spec-suite">The Ruby Spec Suite</h1>
<p>The Ruby Spec Suite is a test suite for the behavior of the Ruby programming language.</p>
<p>It is not a standardized specification like the ISO one, and does not aim to become one. Instead, it is a practical tool to describe and test the behavior of Ruby with code.</p>
<p>Every example code has a textual description, which presents several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to understand the intent of the author</li>
<li>It documents how recent versions of Ruby should behave</li>
<li>It helps Ruby implementations to agree on a common behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>The specs are written with syntax similar to RSpec 2. They are run with MSpec, the purpose-built framework for running the Ruby Spec Suite. For more information, see the project.</p>
<p>The specs describe the <a href="language/">language syntax</a>, the <a href="core/">core library</a>, the <a href="library/">standard library</a>, the <a href="optional/capi">C API for extensions</a> and the <a href="command_line/">command line flags</a>. The language specs are grouped by keyword while the core and standard library specs are grouped by class and method.</p>
<p>ruby/spec is known to be tested in these implementations for every commit: * on 30 platforms and 4 versions * on Travis for both 1.7 and 9.x * on Travis * on Travis</p>
<p>ruby/spec describes the behavior of Ruby 2.2 and more recent Ruby versions. More precisely, every latest stable MRI release all specs of ruby/spec (latest 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, etc).</p>
<p>For older specs try these commits: * Ruby 2.0.0-p647 - * Ruby 2.1.9 -</p>
