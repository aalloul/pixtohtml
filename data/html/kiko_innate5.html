<p>Options has namespaces, inheritance, defaults, triggers, documentation, and a sane name.</p>
<p>The definition syntax roughly resembles Ramaze::Global.</p>
<p>We break with the tradition where all options one would ever need were provided in one file. It made maintenance rather difficult and the code hard to follow. So the new approach is to put options where they belong, alongside the class or module they are used in.</p>
<p>There are some things still in Innate.options, but they have large impact on the whole system.</p>
<p>Options doesnâ€™t do things like merging env variables or parsing ARGV, these are things that Ramaze adds.</p>
<p>What makes Options especially useful is that you can use it in your own application to configure it without using diverse routes like putting config into counter-intuitive yaml files, using global variables, or relying on yet another dependency.</p>
<p>A small example:</p>
<pre><code>module Blog
  include Innate::Optioned

  options.dsl do
    o &quot;Title of the blog&quot;, :title, &quot;My Blog&quot;
    o &quot;Syntax highlighting engine for blog posts&quot;, :syntax, :coderay
  end

  class Articles
    Innate.node &#39;/&#39;

    def index
      &quot;Welcome to #{Blog.options.title}&quot;
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
<h3 id="controller">Controller</h3>
<p>Away with controllers, long live the Node.</p>
<p>Nodes are objects that include Innate::Node and are then considered rack applications that get automatically hooked into the routing.</p>
<p>Since every existing Ramaze application relies on Ramaze::Controller and normal</p>
