<h2 id="maintenance-team">Maintenance team</h2>
<p>Prawn has always been heavily dependent on community contributions, with dozens of people contributing code over the year. In that sense, the lines have blurred to the point where we no longer have a strong distinction between core developers and contributors.</p>
<p>That said, there are a few folks who have been responsible for cutting releases, merging important pull requests, and making major decisions about the overall direction of the project.</p>
<h3 id="current-maintainers">Current maintainers</h3>
<p>These are the folks to contact if you have a maintenance-related issue with Prawn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alexander Mankuta (</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inactive-maintainers">Inactive maintainers</h3>
<p>These folks have helped out in a maintenance role in the past, but are no longer actively involved in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gregory Brown (</li>
<li>Brad Ediger (</li>
<li>James Healy (</li>
<li>Daniel Nelson (</li>
<li>Jonathan Greenberg (</li>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Prawn was originally developed by <a href="http://twitter.com/practicingruby">Gregory Brown</a>, under the auspices of the Ruby Mendicant Project, a grassroots initiative in which the Ruby community collectively provided funding so that Gregory could take several months off from work to focus on this project.</p>
