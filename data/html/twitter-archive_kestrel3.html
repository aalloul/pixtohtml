<p>Building from source is easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ sbt clean update package-dist</code></pre>
<p>Scala libraries and dependencies will be downloaded from maven repositories the first time you do a build. The finished distribution will be in <code>dist</code>.</p>
<h2 id="running-it">Running it</h2>
<p>You can run kestrel by hand, in development mode, via:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dist/kestrel-VERSION/scripts/devel.sh</code></pre>
<p>Like all ostrich-based servers, it uses the “stage” property to determine which config file to load, so <code>devel.sh</code> sets <code>-Dstage=development</code>.</p>
<p>When running it as a server, a startup script is provided in <code>dist/kestrel-VERSION/scripts/kestrel.sh</code>. The script assumes you have <code>daemon</code>, a standard daemonizer for Linux, but also available for all common unix platforms.</p>
<p>The created archive <code>kestrel-VERSION.zip</code> can be expanded into a place like <code>/usr/local</code> (or wherever you like) and executed within its own folder as a self-contained package. All dependent jars are included. The current startup script, however, assumes that kestrel has been deployed to <code>/usr/local/kestrel/current</code> (e.g., as if by capistrano), and the startup script loads kestrel from that path.</p>
<p>The default configuration puts logfiles into <code>/var/log/kestrel/</code> and queue journal files into <code>/var/spool/kestrel/</code>.</p>
<p>The startup script logs extensive GC information to a file named <code>stdout</code> in the log folder. If kestrel has problems starting up (before it can initialize logging), it will usually appear in <code>error</code> in the same folder.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Queue configuration is described in detail in <code>docs/guide.md</code> (an operational guide). Scala docs for the config variables are .</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Several performance tests are included. To run them, first start up a kestrel instance</p>
