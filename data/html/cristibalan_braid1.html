<h1 id="braid">Braid</h1>
<p>Braid is a simple tool to help track vendor branches in a repository.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Vendoring allows you take the source code of an external library and ensure it’s version controlled along with the main project. This is in contrast to including a reference to a packaged version of an external library that is available in a binary artifact repository such as Maven Central, RubyGems or NPM.</p>
<p>Vendoring is useful when you need to patch or customize the external libraries or the external library is expected to co-evolve with the main project. The developer can make changes to the main project and patch the library in a single commit.</p>
<p>The problem arises when the external library makes changes that you want to integrate into your local vendored version or the developer makes changes to the local version that they want integrated into the external library.</p>
<p>A typical “implementation” of vendoring is to simply download or checkout the source for the external library, remove the <code>.git</code> or <code>.svn</code> directories and commit it to the main source tree. However this approach makes it very difficult to update the library. When you want to update the library do you re-apply your local changes onto a new copy of the vendored library or do you re-apply the changes from the external library to local version? Both cases involve manual generation and application of patch files to source trees.</p>
<p>This is where Braid comes into play. Braid makes it easy to vendor in remote git repositories and use an automated mechanism for updating the external library and generating patches to upgrade the external library.</p>
<p>Braid creates a file <code>.braids.json</code> in the root of your repository that contains references to external libraries or mirrors. The configuration allows you to control aspects of the mirroring process such as;</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the mirror is locked to a particular version of the external library.</li>
<li>whether the mirror is tracking a tag or a branch.</li>
<li>whether the mirror includes the entire external library or just a subdirectory.</li>
</ul>
