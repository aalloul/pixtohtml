<ul>
<li>Room</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-people">The People</h4>
<p>All the users registered on the application.</p>
<p>Only the users that have mark on his profile the ‘Public profile’ check will be appear here. If an Admin is logged he will see all the Users inclusive the not ‘Public profiles’.</p>
<h5 id="show-all">Show All</h5>
<p>All the Users registered</p>
<h5 id="show-attendees">Show Attendees</h5>
<p>This is a hack.. all the Users that have paid the Event with id == 1 will appear on this list.</p>
<p>As usual only the ‘Public profile’ will be shown for the users not Admin.</p>
<p>See the ‘/app/views/users/index.html.erb’ to see this menu and adapt it to your needs.</p>
<h5 id="show-speakers">Show Speakers</h5>
<p>All the users associated to a Talk on ‘Accepted’ status will appear in this list.</p>
<p>If an Admin is logged he will see all the users associated to a Talk even the Talk is no on ‘Accepted’ status.</p>
<h5 id="exports">Exports</h5>
<p>All the lists could be exported to:</p>
<ul>
<li>xml</li>
<li>pdf</li>
<li>csv</li>
</ul>
<p>Look the links at the end of the lists.</p>
<h4 id="payments">Payments</h4>
<p>This is important to be checked very carefully.</p>
<p>The best way to check this is one time you have the app on production you can create an Event with a cost of 1 euro (100 cents), for example, and try to pay for it.</p>
<p>You always can go to the seller paypal account and refund this payment.</p>
<p>On the menu ‘Payments’ you can see all the carts (like the cart on any kind of online store) but all the carts on status ‘On session’ don’t mean anything it is just for debugging.</p>
<p>The important status are:</p>
<h5 id="completed">Completed</h5>
<p>What means the payment has been accepted.</p>
<h5 id="not-notified-by-paypal">Not Notified by PayPal</h5>
<p>Very strange status that means the user have gone to paypal but paypal has not notified us.</p>
