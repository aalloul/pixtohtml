<ul>
<li>The simulation is done at a whole-frame level, meaning that lots of 6545 programming tricks that were achieved by updating the frame address during vertical and horizontal sync times are not achievable. There is no way (for example) to change the Display Start Address (R12 and R13) while a frame is being drawn.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the 6545 CRTC and its programming model, please see the following resources</p>

<h2 id="usage">4.0 Usage</h2>
<h3 id="building">4.1 Building</h3>
<p>To build Symon with Apache Maven, just type:</p>
<pre><code>$ mvn package</code></pre>
<p>Maven will build Symon, run unit tests, and produce a jar file in the <code>target</code> directory containing the compiled simulator.</p>
<p>Symon is meant to be invoked directly from the jar file. To run with Java 1.8 or greater, just type:</p>
<pre><code>$ java -jar symon-1.2.0.jar</code></pre>
<p>When Symon is running, you should be presented with a simple graphical interface.</p>
<h3 id="rom-images">4.2 ROM images</h3>
<p>The simulator requires a ROM image loaded into memory to work properly. Without a ROM in memory, the simulator will not be able to reset, since the reset vector for the 6502 is located in the ROM</p>
