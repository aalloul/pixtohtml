<h2 id="contributingdevelopment">Contributing/Development</h2>
<p>Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to read the .</p>
<p>You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We document the process on the page of the Chef wiki.</p>
<p>Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do use TDD with RSpec, so you’ll need to get a development environment running. Follow the above procedure (“Installing from Git”) to get your local copy of the source running.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h2>
<p>Issues can be reported by using .</p>
<p>Full details on how to report issues can be found in the doc.</p>
<p>Note that this repository is primarily for reporting chef-client issues. For reporting issues against other Chef projects, please look up the appropriate repository to report issues against in the Chef docs in the . If you can’t detemine the appropriate place to report an issue, then please open it against the repository you think best fits and it will be directed to the appropriate project.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>We use RSpec for unit/spec tests. It is not necessary to start the development environment to run the specs–they are completely standalone.</p>
<pre><code># Run All the Tests
bundle exec rake spec

# Run a Single Test File</code></pre>
