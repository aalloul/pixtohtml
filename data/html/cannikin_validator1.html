<p>Validator is a Javascript framework for simple client-side validation of form fields.</p>
<p>Server-side validation is essential, but client-side validation gives the user immediate feedback as they’re filling out a form and can save a round-trip to the server just to find out that a password was one character too short. Client-side validation can’t tell you if a value is already taken in the database, but it’s perfect for determining if a field is blank, too short or meets a certain format guideline (valid email address, 10-digit phone number, etc.).</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<p>Validator relies on Prototype: http://prototypejs.org</p>
<h1 id="starting-up-validator">Starting up Validator</h1>
To include Validator on your page, simply include a
<script> tag to the .js files:

  <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/prototype.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/validator.js"></script>
To use Validator you need a valid
<form>
<p>and some form elements on the page. That form has to have an id – Validator references the id to know which form to validate (you can have multiple forms on a page, and multiple Validators checking them).</p>
At some point in your code <em>after</em> the closing
</form>
<p>tag, you’re going to open a script block and create an instance of Validator:</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var v = new Validator('my_form');
  </script>
<p>Where ‘my_form’ is whatever the id of your form is. Specifiying the id of the form is required because you could have multiple forms and multiple Validators checking them. Now the validator is ready to go. By default the validator will validate the entire form at once when you submit it (either by clicking an input of type=“submit” or submitting it via Javascript). If any field is invalid, the submission will be cancelled and the invalid fields will be noted (see “How Fields are Marked Valid/Invalid” below).</p>
<h1 id="validating-fields">Validating Fields</h1>
<p>The easiest validation you can do is to add a class=“required” to any field you want to automatically be checked for blank-ness. If the value of a field with the “required” class is empty (value == ’’) when checked, it will be marked invalid.</p>
<p><input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" class="required" /></p>
