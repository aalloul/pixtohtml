<h2 id="welcome-to-railfrog">Welcome to Railfrog!</h2>
<p>Railfrog is a simple and straightforward Content Management System for publishing websites.</p>
<h3 id="beware-there-are-two-of-them">Beware! There are two of them!</h3>
<p>The first thing you must know is that Railfrog comes in two flavours.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First we have <strong>Railfrog</strong> itself: this is a <em>Ruby on Rails Engine</em> and you will find it at <a href="http://github.com/railfrog/railfrog/tree/master" class="uri">http://github.com/railfrog/railfrog/tree/master</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then we have the <strong>Railfrog Content Management System</strong> which is an application using the Railfrog engine to build a simple CMS. You can find it at <a href="http://github.com/railfrog/railfrogcms/tree/master" class="uri">http://github.com/railfrog/railfrogcms/tree/master</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Railfrog engine can be integrated into any Ruby on Rails application, effectively extending the application with simple content management capabilities. You will use the Railfrog engine if you are developing Ruby on Rails applications yourself, or if you are contributing back to the Railfrog project.</p>
<p>The Railfrog CMS is a simple ready to use content management system. You will use this one if you just want to get started using Railfrog as standalone web publishing tool. You will probably also want to start with RailfrogCMS if you are just beggining to explore Railfrog’s capabilities.</p>
<p>We strongly suggest that you start with RailfrogCMS, and the remainder of these instructions will assume this is the case. Once you are familiar with RailfrogCMS, using the Railfrog engine in your own projects is covered in the <a href="http://github.com/railfrog/railfrog/tree/master">project documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>Railfrog is built on top of Ruby on Rails, and runs anywhere you can get Ruby on Rails running: that is, on most current platforms, including Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux. We expect that most people will be using a Rails-enabled web host or perhaps a VPS to deploy their application, and perhaps a laptop if you want a separate system for for testing and development.</p>
<p>You need to have the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ruby interpreter</strong>. We currently require Ruby version 1.8.6. Note that Ruby 1.8.7 is not currently supported. If you are on Mac OS/X or on Linux, you will most likely have Ruby available; otherwise you can get it from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org" class="uri">http://www.ruby-lang.org</a>. If you are on Windows, the quickest way to get ruby is using the .</li>
<li><strong>RubyGems</strong>. Again, this may already be installed; on Windows it’s included in the “one click installer”. If you don’t yet have it, see the for installation instructions.</li>
<li><strong>SQLite</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> or <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. There’s also a which we haven’t tested, please let us know if you have problems with one of these.</li>
<li><strong>Git</strong>. If you do not have git on your system, see “”. On Windows we recommend the msysGit “official full installer” package. Git will be used to clone the railfrogcms repository; all required resources, including the appropriate version of Rails, will then be installed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to do more than just install the Railfrog CMS and publish a website, you should be familiar with Ruby on Rails. If you are not, then you might want to go through the guide.</p>
<p>Before you proceed with installation, you may want to make sure you are able to create and start a simple Ruby on Rails application. This is not required, but will reassure you that you have all the required bits and pieces installed and running (the ruby interpreter, the database, the web server, etc.). If you’re on Windows, this may save you some pain.</p>
<p>While you might have Ruby on Rails already installed on your system (or you installed it yourself following the above mentioned Getting Started guide), when you perform the following instructions to install the Railfrog CMS, you will get a specific version of Rails installed under the <em>vendor</em> directory. This is to ensure that Railfrog runs against the specific version of Rails that is needed (and that one might <em>not</em> be the same as the one that is already installed on your computer).</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Railfrog setup currently requires that you use a commandline “shell” (called Command Prompt, Terminal or Konsole on various platforms) - but even if you have not done this before, it’s very straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the following instructions we are prefixing all the commands with “sudo”, which is what you need to gain administrator privileges on Linux and Mac. If you are on Windows, type the same commands at the “C:\&gt;” prompt (Start | All Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt), but without the “sudo”.</p>
