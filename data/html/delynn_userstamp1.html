<h1 id="userstamp-plugin-v-2.0">Userstamp Plugin (v 2.0)</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Userstamp Plugin extends to add automatic updating of ‘creator’, ‘updater’, and ‘deleter’ attributes. It is based loosely on the module.</p>
<p>Two class methods (<code>model_stamper</code> and <code>stampable</code>) are implemented in this plugin. The <code>model_stamper</code> method is used in models that are responsible for creating, updating, or deleting other objects. The <code>stampable</code> method is used in models that are subject to being created, updated, or deleted by ‘stampers’.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation of the plugin can be done using the built in Rails plugin script. Issue the following command from the root of your Rails application:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./script/rails plugin install git://github.com/delynn/userstamp.git</code></pre>
<p>or add it to your Gemfile:</p>
<pre><code>gem &#39;userstamp&#39;</code></pre>
<p>and run <code>bundle install</code> to install the new dependency.</p>
<p>Once installed you will need to restart your application for the plugin to be loaded into the Rails environment.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>In this new version of the Userstamp plug-in, the assumption is that you have two different categories of objects; those that manipulate, and those that are manipulated. For those objects that are being manipulated there’s the Stampable module and for the manipulators there’s the Stamper module. There’s also the actual Userstamp module for your controllers that assists in setting up your environment on a per request basis.</p>
<p>To better understand how all this works, I think an example is in order. For this example we will assume that a weblog application is comprised of User and Post objects. The first thing we need to do is create the migrations for these objects, and the plug-in gives you a <code>userstamps</code> method for very easily doing this:</p>
<p>```ruby class CreateUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up create_table :users, :force =&gt; true do |t|</p>
