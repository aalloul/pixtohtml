<p>The previously published version of Launchy before the 2.0.0 series was 0.4.0. There have been so many changes, and a mistaken tag at 1.0.0, that I have decided to bump all the way to 2.x.y.</p>
<p>I have attempted to keep backward compatibility with the previous examples. The previous API examples of:</p>
<pre><code>Launchy::Browser.run(&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>Launchy::Browser.new.visit(&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>will still work, and you will get a deprecation notice, along with the line of code you should probably update. For example, this is what would print out in the github gem if it was updated to use 2.0.x but not use the supported API.</p>
