<h1 id="idgen32">Idgen32</h1>
<p>Idgen32 functions provide a facility to generate a stream of 32-bit numbers that are strongly unpredictable and have a repetition cycle close to 2^32. Such numbers are useful as protocol identifiers where there are negative consequences to reusing an ID within a short time period, as may happen if they are simply assigned at random.</p>
<p>Note that this function will never return 0 as it often has a special meaning in network protocols.</p>
<h2 id="dependencies">DEPENDENCIES</h2>
<p>Require a compiler and the standard C library. arc4random on linux is needed (provided via libbsd-dev on ubuntu/debian)</p>
<p>If you want to run the tests you’ll need to have the following dependencies installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>minitest</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage">USAGE</h2>
