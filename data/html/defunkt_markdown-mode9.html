<pre><code>increasing the level (demoting).  Similarly, the left and right
arrow keys indicate the direction that the atx heading markup
is moving in when promoting or demoting.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Completion: <kbd>C-c C-]</kbd></p>
<p>Complete markup is in normalized form, which means, for example, that the underline portion of a setext header is the same length as the heading text, or that the number of leading and trailing hash marks of an atx header are equal and that there is no extra whitespace in the header text. <kbd>C-c C-]</kbd> completes the markup at the point, if it is determined to be incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p>Editing Lists: <kbd>M-RET</kbd>, <kbd>C-c UP</kbd>, <kbd>C-c DOWN</kbd>, <kbd>C-c LEFT</kbd>, and <kbd>C-c RIGHT</kbd></p>
<p>New list items can be inserted with <kbd>M-RET</kbd> or <kbd>C-c C-j</kbd>. This command determines the appropriate marker (one of the possible unordered list markers or the next number in sequence for an ordered list) and indentation level by examining nearby list items. If there is no list before or after the point, start a new list. As with heading insertion, you may prefix this command by <kbd>C-u</kbd> to decrease the indentation by one level. Prefix this command by <kbd>C-u C-u</kbd> to increase the indentation by one level.</p>
<p>Existing list items (and their nested sub-items) can be moved up or down with <kbd>C-c UP</kbd> or <kbd>C-c DOWN</kbd> and indented or outdented with <kbd>C-c RIGHT</kbd> or <kbd>C-c LEFT</kbd>.</p></li>
<li><p>Editing Subtrees: <kbd>C-c UP</kbd>, <kbd>C-c DOWN</kbd>, <kbd>C-c LEFT</kbd>, and <kbd>C-c RIGHT</kbd></p>
<p>Entire subtrees of ATX headings can be promoted and demoted with <kbd>C-c LEFT</kbd> and <kbd>C-c RIGHT</kbd>, which are the same keybindings used for promotion and demotion of list items. If the point is in a list item, the operate on the list item. Otherwise, they operate on the current heading subtree. Similarly, subtrees can be moved up and down with <kbd>C-c UP</kbd> and <kbd>C-c DOWN</kbd>.</p>
<p>These commands currently do not work properly if there are Setext headings in the affected region.</p>
<p>Please note the following “boundary” behavior for promotion and demotion. Any level-six headings will not be demoted further (i.e., they remain at level six, since Markdown and HTML define only six levels) and any level-one headings will promoted away entirely (i.e., heading markup will be removed, since a level-zero heading is not defined).</p></li>
<li><p>Shifting the Region: <kbd>C-c &lt;</kbd> and <kbd>C-c &gt;</kbd></p></li>
