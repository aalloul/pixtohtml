<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>Test2 - Framework for writing test tools that all work together.</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Test2 is a new testing framework produced by forking , completely refactoring it, adding many new features and capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-new">WHAT IS NEW?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Easier to test new testing tools.</p>
<p>From the beginning Test2 was built with introspection capabilities. With Test::Builder it was difficult at best to capture test tool output for verification. Test2 Makes it easy with <code>Test2::API::intercept()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Better diagnostics capabilities.</p>
<p>Test2 uses an object to track filename, line number, and tool details. This object greatly simplifies tracking for where errors should be reported.</p></li>
<li><p>Event driven.</p>
<p>Test2 based tools produce events which get passed through a processing system before being output by a formatter. This event system allows for rich plugin and extension support.</p></li>
<li><p>More complete API.</p>
<p>Test::Builder only provided a handful of methods for generating lines of TAP. Test2 took inventory of everything people were doing with Test::Builder that required hacking it up. Test2 made public API functions for nearly all the desired functionality people didnâ€™t previously have.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for output other than TAP.</p>
<p>Test::Builder assumed everything would end up as TAP. Test2 makes no such assumption. Test2 provides ways for you to specify alternative and custom formatters.</p></li>
<li><p>Subtest implementation is more sane.</p>
<p>The Test::Builder implementation of subtests was certifiably insane. Test2 uses a stacked event hub system that greatly improves how subtests are implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for threading/forking.</p>
<p>Test2 support for forking and threading can be turned on using .</p></li>
</ul>
